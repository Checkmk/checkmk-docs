:title: Monitor a website
:description: To check the accessibility of a website or web service you need an alternative solution to using the Checkmk agent, a so-called active check. This is one that is not performed by an agent, rather by directly contacting a network protocol at the target host, in this case HTTP(S).


[#create_host]
== Create the host

++++1. From the menu on the left, open *Setup > Hosts > Hosts*.

++++2. If you have already created folders, you can also go to a folder in which you want to store the website connection.

++++3. Click *Add host*.

++++4. Enter the *Host name*, e.g. _Website_connection_.

++++5. Under Monitoring agents, tick the *Checkmk agent / API integrations* and select *No API integrations, no Checkmk agent*.

++++6. Click *Save & view folder*.

Do not run a service discovery, even if it is recommended.


[#create_rule]
== Create the rule

++++1. From the menu on the left, open *Setup* and type _Check HTTP_ into the search field.

++++2. Select *Check HTTP web service*.

++++3. Click *Add rule*.


[#rule_content]
== Fill in the rule

++++1. In the section *Value*, click *Add new endpoint*.

++++2. Enter the *Name*, e.g. _checkmk.com_.

++++3. In the field *URL* type _https://www.checkmk.com_.

++++4. In the section *Conditions*, click *Explicit hosts*.

++++5. Select _website_connection_ from the related drop down menu.

++++6. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

However, the _Onboarding Guide_ you are currently reading is covering the top right corner and thus the yellow button.
So, close the Guide, click the yellow button and open the Guide again.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.
