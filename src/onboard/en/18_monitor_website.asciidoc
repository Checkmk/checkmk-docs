:title: Monitor a website
:description: To check the accessibility of a website or web service, you need a solution other than the Checkmk agent, a so-called active check. This is one that is not carried out by an agent, rather by directly contacting a network protocol at the target host, in this case HTTP(S).


[#create_host]
== Create a host

With the following example the `checkmk.com` website is configured for and added to the monitoring:

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > Hosts* to open the *Main* folder page and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Ffolder%3D%26mode%3Dnewhost[Add host]*.

++++2. Set *Host name* to `checkmk.com`.

//If you enter the suggested name, you can jump via link to the Checkmk user interface also in the following steps of this topic.

++++3. In the *Monitoring agents* box, set *Checkmk agent / API integrations* and select *No API integrations, no Checkmk agent*.

++++4. Click *Save & view folder*.


[#configure_active_check]
== Configure the active check

A website is monitored by a so-called _active check_.
This check is configured with a rule:

++++1. Click *Setup > Services > HTTP, TCP, Email, ... > Check HTTP web service* and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fcsrf_token%3D00912545-1dea-4e77-851a-19d79cad7a4c%26filled_in%3Dnew_rule%26ruleset_back_mode%3Drulesets%26rule_folder%3D%26varname%3Dactive_checks%253Ahttpv2%26mode%3Dnew_rule%26folder%3D%26_new_dflt_rule%3DSET[Add rule]*.

++++2. In the *Value* box, click *Add new endpoint*.

++++3. Set *Name* to `Basic website health` and *URL* to `\https://www.checkmk.com`.

++++4. In the *Conditions* box, check *Explicit hosts* and select the *checkmk.com* host you created previously.

++++5. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

image::onboarding_button_pending_changes.png[alt="Button on 'Setup' pages with number of pending changes."]

This opens the *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dchangelog[Activate pending changes]* page.

However, the _Onboarding Guide_ you are currently reading is covering the top right corner and thus the yellow button.
So, close the Guide, click the yellow button and open the Guide again.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.

Checkmk initially saves all changes you make in the *Setup* menu in a temporary _configuration environment_.
Only by activating the pending changes these will be transferred to the _monitoring environment_.
The monitoring environment is accessed via the *Monitor menu*.

This step concludes the Monitor a website topic.
