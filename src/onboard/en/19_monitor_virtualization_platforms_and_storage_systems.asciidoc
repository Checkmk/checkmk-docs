== We are actively working on a solution

Please note that monitoring virtualization platforms (e.g. vSphere, Proxmox etc.), Kubernetes, and storage solutions, and other systems that are not accessible from outside your network and are being monitored via a special agent is not possible in this beta version of Checkmk Cloud SaaS.

However, we understand the importance of these features and are actively working on them. They are on our roadmap for the public release, and we are committed to providing these capabilities soon. Thank you for your understanding and patience as we enhance our product.
