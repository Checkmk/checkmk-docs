:title: Configure check parameters for a service
:description: To monitor services correctly, they require their parameters to be well-defined. How to set parameters for services is therefore explained here.


[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You have already created one or more hosts and discovered the services.
Every service has *_Default values_* for the parameters.

Those can now be set to meet your needs.
The most common practice is the setting of thresholds for WARN and CRIT.


[#host_properties]
== Locate the host properties

As the available services depend on the hosts you are working with, we will be using an example to decribe the general approach.

If we assume that you monitor a Unix system, you should have the *CPU load* service in most cases.
In case you don't have this service, you may use any other service to follow the below descriptions.
 
The exact parameters a service eventually has can be found in the service's parameters page:

++++1. Open *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dfolder[Hosts]* from the menu on the left.

++++2. Click on the name of the desired host to open the *Properties of host*.


[#service_discovery]
== Run a service discovery

++++1. Click *Save & run service discovery*.


[#edit_parameters]
== Edit the parameters

You should now see the *Services of host*.

++++1. Select the desired service, e.g. *CPU load* and click the bar chart symbol to open the context menu.

++++2. Click *Add rule*.

++++3. Modify the *Value* to fit your needs. In our example, we decrease the *Levels on CPU load* from the default settings.

++++4. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

However, the _Onboarding Guide_ you are currently reading is covering the top right corner and thus the yellow button.
So, close the Guide, click the yellow button and open the Guide again.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.



[#show_parameters]
== Make the parameters visible

You can display the parameters from all services directly in the service table:

++++1. Open *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dfolder[Hosts]* from the menu on the left.

++++2. Click on the name of the desired host to open the *Properties of host*.

++++3. Click *Save & run service discovery*.

++++4. In the menu bar click *Display > Details > Show check parameters*.

Now, an additional column is displayed in the *Services of host* showing the currently set parameters for each service.

These steps gave a brief introduction on how to modify and check parameters for services.
