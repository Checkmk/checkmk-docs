:title: Monitor Azure
:description: Use Checkmk to collect, analyze, and visualize data related to the performance and health of a Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure. Monitoring Azure deals with all the operational areas of an Azure cloud, such as applications, virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and databases.


[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you start with Checkmk, collect the following information about the Microsoft Azure account for the cloud infrastructure you want to monitor with Checkmk: _subscription ID_ and _tenant ID_ (also known _directory ID_).

In addition, you need to register Checkmk in the Azure portal as application so that you can work with the Azure API.
For this application you need its _application ID_ (or _client ID_) and the related client secret.

You will be asked to enter this information into Checkmk when configuring the Azure agent.

You can find details on how to retrieve this information in the link:https://docs.checkmk.com/saas/en/monitoring_azure.html#preparation[Checkmk Cloud User Guide].


[#create_host]
== Create a host

Monitoring Azure requires a host to be created in Checkmk:

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dfolder[Hosts]* to open the *Main* folder page.

++++2. Click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Ffolder%3D%26mode%3Dnewhost[Add host]*.

++++3. Set *Host name* to `azure`.

You are free to choose the host name.
However, if you select the suggested name, you can jump via link to the Checkmk user interface also in the following steps of this topic.

++++4. Set *IP address family* to *No IP*.

++++5. Click *Save & view folder*.


[#configure_azure]
== Configure the Azure agent

An Azure cloud infrastructure is monitored by a so-called _special agent_.
This agent is configured with a rule:

++++1. Click *Setup > Agents > VM, cloud, container > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fback_mode%3Drulesets%26mode%3Dedit_ruleset%26search_p_ruleset_deprecated%3D60a33e6cf5151f2d52eddae9685cfa270426aa89d8dbc7dfb854606f1d1a40fe%26search_p_ruleset_deprecated_USE%3Don%26search_p_ruleset_group%3D5bd1d46aa910d626faf9b049abbdbdc3930bfd636d980f3f57d326bb3cd43957%26search_p_ruleset_group_USE%3Don%26varname%3Dspecial_agents%253Aazure[Microsoft Azure)]* to open the *Microsoft Azure* page.

++++2. Click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fcsrf_token%3D8ca7ad0f-823c-4276-ac37-61941704ef72%26filled_in%3Dnew_rule%26ruleset_back_mode%3Drulesets%26rule_folder%3D%26varname%3Dspecial_agents%253Aazure%26mode%3Dnew_rule%26folder%3D%26_new_dflt_rule%3DSET[Add rule]*.

++++3. In the *Microsoft Azure* box, check *Subscription ID*.

++++4. Set *Subscription ID*, *Tenant ID / Directory ID*, *Client ID / Application ID* and *Client Secret* to the values you previously looked up in the Azure portal.

++++5. In *Azure services to monitor* select the Azure services to be monitored by the special agent.

++++6. In *Retrieve information about...* you can enter dedicated resource groups or resources that you want to monitor.
If you have not checked *explicitly specified groups*, all resource groups are automatically monitored.

++++7. In *Map data relating to VMs* you decide on how the virtual machine (VM) data are assigned to Checkmk hosts.
// TK: mehr infos?

++++8. In the *Conditions* box, check *Explicit hosts* and select the *azure* host you created previously.

++++9. Click *Save*.


[#service_discovery]
== Run a service discovery

The service discovery detects all available services that are associated with the `azure` host:

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dfolder[Hosts]*.

++++2. In the *Hosts* table, click the pencil icon left to the *azure* host to edit the *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Ffolder%3D%26host%3Dazure%26mode%3Dedit_host[Properties of host azure]*.

++++3. Click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Ffolder%3D%26host%3Dazure%26mode%3Dinventory[Save & run service discovery]*.

On the *Services of host azure* page you specify which services you want to monitor on the host.
The usual method for adding the newly discovered services is to simply accept all.
That way also all host labels will be added in one go.

++++4. Click *Accept all*.


[#setup_dcd]
== Setup dynamic host management

This step is only required if you want to monitor Azure resource groups and virtual machine (VM) instances.
Services that are assigned to these groups and instances are not assigned to the `gcp` host, but to so-called _piggyback_ hosts.
You can leave the creation and deletion of these piggyback hosts to Checkmk's _dynamic host management_.

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Ddcd_connections[Dynamic host management]*.

++++2. Click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dedit_dcd_connection[Add connection]*.

++++3. In the *General properties* box, enter a unique ID and a title for the connection.

++++4. In the *Connection properties* box, check *Restrict source hosts* and enter the `azure` host.

++++5. In *Piggyback creation options > Create hosts in* you can select a folder other than *Main* (if already present) in which the piggyback hosts are to be created.

++++6. The preselected *Host attributes to set* are in general correct for piggyback hosts and do not need to be altered.

++++6. In *Delete vanished hosts* check *Automatically delete hosts without piggyback data*.

++++7. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

Checkmk initially saves all changes you make in the *Setup* menu in a temporary _configuration environment_.
Only by activating the pending changes these will be transferred to the _monitoring environment_.
The monitoring environment is accessed via the *Monitor menu*.

There are two ways to get to the *Activate pending changes* page:

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

image::onboarding_button_pending_changes.png[alt="Button on 'Setup' pages with number of pending changes."]

However, the _Onboarding Guide_ you are currently reading is covering the top right corner and thus the yellow button.
So, close the Guide, click the yellow button and open the Guide again.

The second way requires a few more mouse clicks:

Click *Setup > General > Audit log > Related > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dchangelog[Activate pending changes]*.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.


[#open_dashboards]
== Open Azure dashboards

For a convenient start into monitoring Azure, Checkmk ships two built-in dashboards:

++++1. Click *Monitor > Cloud* and then  *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fdashboard.py%3Fname%3Dazure_vm_overview[Azure VM instances]* or 
*link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fdashboard.py%3Fname%3Dazure_storage_overview[Azure storage accounts]*.    

This step concludes the Monitor Azure topic.
