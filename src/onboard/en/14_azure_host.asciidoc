:title: Monitor Azure
:description: Use Checkmk to collect, analyze, and visualize data related to the performance and health of a Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure. Monitoring Azure deals with all the operational areas of an Azure cloud, such as applications, virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and databases.


[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you start with Checkmk, collect the following information about the Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure you want to monitor with Checkmk: the _subscription ID_ and the _tenant ID_ of your Azure account.

In addition, you will need to register Checkmk in the Azure portal as an application so that you can work with the Azure API.
For this application you will need its _client ID_ and the related _client secret_.

You will be asked to enter this information into Checkmk when configuring the Azure agent.

You can find details on how to retrieve this information in the link:https://docs.checkmk.com/saas/en/monitoring_azure.html#preparation[Checkmk Cloud User Guide^].


[#create_host]
== Create a host

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > Hosts* to open the *Main* folder page and then click *link:wato.py?folder=&mode=newhost["Add host", window=main]*.

++++2. Set *Host name* to `azure`.

If you enter the suggested name, you can also jump via link to the Checkmk user interface in the following steps within this topic.

++++3. Set *IP address family* to *No IP*.

++++4. Click *Save & view folder*.


[#configure_azure]
== Configure the Azure agent

An Azure cloud infrastructure is monitored by a so-called _special agent_.
This agent is configured using a rule:

++++1. Click *Setup > Agents > VM, cloud, container > Microsoft Azure* and then click *link:wato.py?filled_in=new_rule&ruleset_back_mode=rulesets&rule_folder=&varname=special_agents%3Aazure&mode=new_rule&folder=&_new_dflt_rule=SET["Add rule", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Microsoft Azure* box, check *Subscription ID*.

++++3. Set *Subscription ID*, *Tenant ID / Directory ID*, *Client ID / Application ID* and *Client Secret* to the values you previously looked up in the Azure portal.

++++4. In *Azure services to monitor* select the Azure services to be monitored by the special agent.

++++5. In *Retrieve information about...* you can enter dedicated resource groups or resources that you want to monitor.
If you have not checked *explicitly specified groups*, all resource groups will automatically be monitored.

++++6. In *Map data relating to VMs* you can decide whether data on virtual machines (VMs) should be assigned to the (resource) group host or the host of the VM itself.

++++7. In the *Conditions* box, check *Explicit hosts* and select the *azure* host you created previously.

++++8. Click *Save*.


[#service_discovery]
== Run a service discovery

The service discovery detects all available services that are associated with the `azure` host:

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:wato.py?mode=folder["Hosts", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Hosts* table, click the *azure* host name to open the *link:wato.py?folder=&host=azure&mode=edit_host["Properties of host azure", window=main]* page.

++++3. Click *link:wato.py?folder=&host=azure&mode=inventory["Save & run service discovery", window=main]*.

image::onboarding_add_hosts_azure_step4.png[alt="Run service discovery"]

On the *Services of host azure* page you specify which services you want to monitor on the host.
The usual method for adding the newly discovered services is to simply accept all.
In this way all host labels will also be added with a single action.

++++4. Click *Accept all*.


[#setup_dcd]
== Setup dynamic host management

This step is only required if you want to monitor Azure resource groups and virtual machine (VM) instances.
Services that are assigned to these groups and instances are not assigned to the `azure` host, but to so-called _piggyback_ hosts.
You can leave the creation and deletion of these piggyback hosts to Checkmk's _dynamic host management_.

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > Dynamic host management* and then click *link:wato.py?mode=edit_dcd_connection["Add connection", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *General properties* box, enter a unique ID and a title for the connection.

++++3. In the *Connection properties* box, check *Restrict source hosts* and enter the `azure` host.

++++4. In *Piggyback creation options > Create hosts in* you can select a folder other than *Main* (if already present) in which the piggyback hosts are to be created.

++++5. The preselected *Host attributes to set* are in general correct for piggyback hosts and do not need to be altered.

++++6. In *Delete vanished hosts* check *Automatically delete hosts without piggyback data*.

++++7. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click this link *link:wato.py?mode=changelog["Activate pending changes", window=main]*

This opens the activate changes page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.

image::onboarding_activate_changes.png[alt="Activate changes"]

Checkmk initially saves all changes you make in the *Setup* menu in a temporary _configuration environment_.
Only by activating the pending changes these will be transferred to the _monitoring environment_.
The monitoring environment is accessed via the *Monitor menu*.


[#open_dashboards]
== Open Azure dashboards

For a convenient start into monitoring Azure, Checkmk ships two built-in dashboards:

++++1. Click *Monitor > Cloud* and then  *link:dashboard.py?name=azure_vm_overview["Azure VM instances", window=main]* or
*link:dashboard.py?name=azure_storage_overview["Azure storage accounts", window=main]*.

This step concludes the Monitor Azure topic.
