= Assign responsibilities via contact group
:revdate: 2025-04-15
:title: Define responsibility and visibility for a host
:description: To assign the responsibility and visibility for a host to certain users, you have to make them a contact for the host in question. Contacts are assigned to hosts and services via contact groups. A well-defined configuration of contact groups can help when setting up notifications.


[#create_contact_group]
== Create a contact group

In this step, you create a contact group for all users who are responsible for Windows servers:

++++1. Go to *Setup > Users > Contact groups* and then click *link:wato.py?mode=contact_groups["Add group", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Properties* box, set *Name* to `win` and *Alias* to `Windows server`.

++++3. Click *Save*.


[#assign_user]
== Assign a user to a contact group

The contact group for a user is assigned in the user's profile:

++++1. Go to *Setup > Users  > link:wato.py?mode=users["Users", window=main]* and then click the pencil icon in front of the user you want to add to a contact group.

++++2. In the *Contact Groups* box, tick the *Windows server* box.

++++3. Click *Save*.


[#add_host_manually]
== Assign a contact group to a host directly

You can assign a contact group to any host directly:

++++1. Go to *Setup > Hosts > link:wato.py?mode=folder["Hosts", window=main]* to open the *Main* folder page.

++++2. In the *Hosts* table, click the name of the host you want to assign to a contact group.
The *Properties of host* page opens.

++++3. In the *Basic settings* box, check *Permissions*.

++++4. In the *Available* list double-click the contact group you want to assign to add it to the *Selected* list.

++++5. Check the *Add these contact groups to the host* box.

++++6. Click *Save & view folder*.

Alternatively, you can assign a contact group to a folder of hosts (including all subfolders).
To do so, move your cursor to the top part of a folder icon and click the pen icon.
Proceed as before.


[#add_host_by_rule]
== Assign a host to a contact group by rule

You can also bulk-assign hosts to a contact group using a rule.

In this step all Windows servers are assigned to the contact group created in the first step:

++++1. Go to *Setup > Hosts > Host monitoring rules > Assignment of hosts to contact groups* and then click *link:wato.py?filled_in=new_rule&ruleset_back_mode=rulesets&rule_folder=&varname=host_contactgroups&mode=new_rule&folder=&_new_dflt_rule=SET["Add rule", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Assignment of hosts to contact groups* box, select the *Windows server* group you created before.

++++3. In the *Conditions* box, right to *Host labels* click *Add to condition* and set *Label is* to `cmk/os_family:windows`.

++++4. Click *Save*.

In this way you have automatically assigned all current and future hosts that have this label to this contact group.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click this link *link:wato.py?mode=changelog["Activate pending changes", window=main]*

This opens the activate changes page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.
