== Monitor a server

To monitor servers and workstations, Checkmk provides its own agents. To download and install an agent do the following:

++++1. Use the navigation on the very left and go to *Setup > Agents > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dagents[Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX]* to download an agent.

++++2. Choose the appropriate package for your system from the line "*_Agent controller auto-registration_*" and "*download it*".

++++3. "*Install the package*" on the system you want to monitor.

++++4. After successful installation the host will automatically appear in the folder *_Setup > Hosts > Main > preconfigured_agent_*. After a couple of minutes the host will also appear in your monitoring. You can track the individual steps in the audit log which is located in *Setup > General > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dauditlog[Audit log]*.
