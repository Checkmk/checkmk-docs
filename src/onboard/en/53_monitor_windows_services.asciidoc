:title: Monitor Windows services
:description: By default, Checkmk does not monitor any services on your Windows hosts. This is simply because Checkmk does not know which services are important to you. Use the Windows service discovery rule to tell the service discovery which Windows services are to be monitored.


[#windows_service_discovery]
== Find Windows services

With the following example rule {CMK} will search Windows services for Windows event log and DHCP client and creates a separate Checkmk service for each of these Windows services:

++++1. Click *Setup > Services > Discovery rules > Windows service discovery* and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fcsrf_token%3D728ec448-d5bf-4b62-a6e1-fc08f01efb8a%26filled_in%3Dnew_rule%26ruleset_back_mode%3Drulesets%26rule_folder%3D%26varname%3Dinventory_services_rules%26mode%3Dnew_rule%26folder%3D%26_new_dflt_rule%3DSET[Add rule]*.

++++2. In the *Windows service discovery* box, check *Services (Regular Expressions)*.

++++3. In the input field enter `EventLog.\*` and `Dhcp.*` in the next input field that opens.

Inputs are case-sensitive.

++++4. Leave the *Create check* boxes untouched in this rule.

++++5. In the *Conditions* box, make sure that this rule is applied to Windows hosts only.

++++6. Click *Save*.

This completes the definition of _what_.


[#service_discovery]
== Run a service discovery

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dfolder[Hosts]*.

++++2. In the *Hosts* table, click a name of a Windows host to open the *Properties of host* page.

++++3. Click *Save & run service discovery*.

You will find new Checkmk services in the *Undecided services - currently not monitored* table with the names *Service Dhcp* and *Service EventLog*.

++++4. Click *Accept all*.


[#state_and_count]
== Evaluate Windows services

The definition of _how_ defines the thresholds/check parameters for the individual Checkmk services.
If you define these values _not_ in the Windows service discovery rule but with its own, following rule, a change will be valid even without a new service discovery.

In this step, you will change the thresholds for the OK, WARN and CRIT states dependent on the Windows service state and start type:

++++1. Click *Setup > Services > Service monitoring rules > Windows Services* and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fcsrf_token%3D728ec448-d5bf-4b62-a6e1-fc08f01efb8a%26filled_in%3Dnew_rule%26ruleset_back_mode%3Drulesets%26rule_folder%3D%26varname%3Dcheckgroup_parameters%253Aservices%26mode%3Dnew_rule%26folder%3D%26_new_dflt_rule%3DSET[Add rule]*.

++++2. In the *Value* box, check *Services states*.

++++3. Click *Add new element* and set *Expected state* to *running*, *Start type* to *auto* and *Resulting state* to *OK*.

++++4. Click again *Add new element* and set *Expected state* to *running*, *Start type* to *demand* and *Resulting state* to *WARN*.

++++5. Click the last time *Add new element* and set *Expected state* to *stopped*, *Start type* to *auto* and *Resulting state* to *CRIT*.

++++6. In the *Conditions* box, make sure that this rule is applied to Windows hosts only.

++++7. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

image::onboarding_button_pending_changes.png[alt="Button on 'Setup' pages with number of pending changes."]

This opens the *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dchangelog[Activate pending changes]* page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.

This step concludes the Monitor Windows services topic.
