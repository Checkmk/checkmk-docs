:title: Monitor AWS
:description: Monitoring Amazon Web Services (AWS) is about observing AWS-native solutions, resources, and services that are hosted on the AWS cloud. Checkmk includes a comprehensive module for monitoring AWS in a very detailed way.


[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you start with Checkmk, create a user in AWS with sufficient read-only access for proper monitoring.
When creating this user, you will also have to collect the following information about the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure you want to monitor with Checkmk: the _access key ID_ and the _access key secret_ for the AWS user you created for Checkmk.

You will be asked to enter this information into Checkmk when configuring the AWS agent.

You can find details on how to create this user and retrieve the information in the link:https://docs.checkmk.com/saas/en/monitoring_aws.html#preparation[Checkmk Cloud User Guide^].


[#create_host]
== Create a host

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > Hosts* to open the *Main* folder page and then click *link:wato.py?folder=&mode=newhost["Add host", window=main]*.

++++2. Set *Host name* to `aws`.

If you enter the suggested name, you can also jump via link to the Checkmk user interface in the following steps within this topic.

++++3. Set *IP address family* to *No IP*.

++++4. Click *Save & view folder*.


[#configure_aws]
== Configure the AWS agent

An AWS cloud infrastructure is monitored by a so-called _special agent_.
This agent is configured using a rule:

++++1. Click *Setup > Agents > VM, cloud, container > Amazon Web Services (AWS)* and then click *link:wato.py?filled_in=new_rule&ruleset_back_mode=rulesets&rule_folder=&varname=special_agents%3Aaws&mode=new_rule&folder=&_new_dflt_rule=SET["Add rule", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* box, set *The access key ID for your AWS account* and the *The secret access key for your AWS account* to the values previously looked up in your AWS account.

++++3. In *Global services to monitor* check the global AWS services to be monitored by the special agent, i.e., those that are independent of a region.

++++4. In *Regions to monitor* select your AWS region(s).

++++5. In *Services by region to monitor* you specify which information you want to retrieve from these regions.
By default, all AWS services and the monitoring of their limits are activated.

++++6. In the *Conditions* box, check *Explicit hosts* and select the *aws* host you created previously.

++++7. Click *Save*.


[#service_discovery]
== Run a service discovery

The service discovery detects all available services that are associated with the `aws` host:

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:wato.py?mode=folder["Hosts", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Hosts* table, click the *aws* host name to open the *link:wato.py?folder=&host=aws&mode=edit_host["Properties of host aws", window=main]* page.

++++3. Click *link:wato.py?folder=&host=aws&mode=inventory["Save & run service discovery", window=main]*.

On the *Services of host aws* page you specify which services you want to monitor on the host.
The usual method for adding the newly discovered services is to simply accept all.
In this way all host labels will also be added with a single action.

++++4. Click *Accept all*.


[#setup_dcd]
== Setup dynamic host management

This step is only required if you want to monitor AWS EC2 instances.
Services that are assigned to these instances are not assigned to the `aws` host, but to so-called _piggyback_ hosts.
You can leave the creation and deletion of these piggyback hosts to Checkmk's _dynamic host management_.

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > Dynamic host management* and then click *link:wato.py?mode=edit_dcd_connection["Add connection", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *General properties* box, enter a unique ID and a title for the connection.

++++3. In the *Connection properties* box, check *Restrict source hosts* and enter the `aws` host.

++++4. In *Piggyback creation options > Create hosts in* you can select a folder other than *Main* (if already present) in which the piggyback hosts are to be created.

++++5. The preselected *Host attributes to set* are in general correct for piggyback hosts and do not need to be altered.

++++6. In *Delete vanished hosts* check *Automatically delete hosts without piggyback data*.

++++7. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click this link *link:wato.py?mode=changelog["Activate pending changes", window=main]*

This opens the activate changes page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.

image::onboarding_activate_changes.png[alt="Activate changes"]

Checkmk initially saves all changes you make in the *Setup* menu in a temporary _configuration environment_.
Only by activating the pending changes these will be transferred to the _monitoring environment_.
The monitoring environment is accessed via the *Monitor menu*.


[#open_dashboards]
== Open AWS dashboards

For a convenient start into monitoring AWS, Checkmk ships two built-in dashboards:

++++1. Click *Monitor > Cloud* and then  *link:dashboard.py?name=aws_ec2_overview["AWS EC2 instances", window=main]* or
*link:dashboard.py?name=aws_s3_overview["AWS S3 (object storage)", window=main]*.

This step concludes the Monitor AWS topic.
