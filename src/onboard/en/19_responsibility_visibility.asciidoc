:title: Define responsibility and visibility for a host
:description: To assign the responsibility and visibility of a host to certain users, you have to make them a contact for the host in question. Contacts are assigned to hosts and services via contact groups. A well-defined setup of contact groups can help when setting up notifications.


[#create_contact_group]
== Create a contact group

In this step, you will create a contact group for all users who are responsible for Windows servers:

++++1. Click *Setup > Users > Contact groups* and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Ffolder%3D%26mode%3Dedit_contact_group[Add group]*.

++++2. In the *Properties* box, set *Name* to `win` and *Alias* to `Windows server`.

++++3. Click *Save*.


[#assign_user]
== Assign user to contact group

The contact group of a user is assigned in the profile of the user:

++++1. Click *Setup > Users  > Users* and then click the pen icon in front of the user you want to add to a contact group.

++++2. In the *Contact Groups* box, check the *Windows server* box.

++++3. Click *Save*.


[#add_host_by_rule]
== Assign host to contact group by rule

You can assign hosts to a contact group by bulk with a rule.

In this step all Windows servers will be assigned to the contact group created in the first step:

++++1.  Click *Setup > Hosts > Host monitoring rules > Assignment of hosts to contact groups* and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Ffilled_in%3Dnew_rule%26ruleset_back_mode%3Drulesets%26rule_folder%3D%26varname%3Dhost_contactgroups%26mode%3Dnew_rule%26folder%3D%26_new_dflt_rule%3DSET[Add rule]*.

++++2. In the *Assignment of hosts to contact groups* box, select the *Windows server* group you created before.

++++3. In the *Conditions* box, right of *Host labels* click *Add to condition* and set *Label is* to `cmk/os_family:windows`.

++++4. Click *Save*.

This way you have assigned all current and future host that have this label automatically to this contact group.


[#add_host_manually]
== Assign host to contact group directly

You can also assign any host to a contact group directly:

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dfolder[Hosts]* to open the *Main* folder page.

++++2. In the *Hosts* table, click the name of the host you want to assign to a contact group to open the *Properties of host* page.

++++3. In the *Basic settings* box, check *Permissions*.

++++4. In the *Available* list double-click the contact group you want to assign to add it to the *Selected* list.

++++5. Check the *Add these contact groups to the host* box.

++++6. Click *Save & view folder*.

Alternatively, you can assign a folder of hosts (including all subfolders) to a contact group.
To do so, move your cursor to the top part of a folder icon and click the pen icon.
Proceed as before.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

This opens the *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dchangelog[Activate pending changes]* page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.
