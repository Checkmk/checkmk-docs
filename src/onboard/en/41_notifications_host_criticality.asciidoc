:title: Define notifications based on host criticality
:description: The amount of superfluous notifications sent out by a monitoring system is ideally 0 (in words: zero). In order to get there, one important step is to configure the actual criticality of your hosts and services and sent notifications accordingly.


[#create_notification_rule]
== Create notification rule

++++1. Click *Setup > Events > Notifications* and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Ffolder%3D%26mode%3Dnotification_rule[Add rule]*.

++++2. In the *Notification method* box select your preferred *Notification Method*.

Details on how to configure each of them is available in the link:https://docs.checkmk.com/saas/en/notifications.html#notification_method[Checkmk Cloud User Guide^].

++++3. In the *Conditions* box, check *Match host tags*.

++++4. In the *Tags* section, set *Criticality* to *is* and in the new list that pops up select *Business critical*.

++++5. Click *Save*.


[#assign_criticality]
== Assign criticality to hosts

The criticality of a host is assigned in the host's properties:

++++1. Click *Setup > Hosts > link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dfolder[Hosts]* to open the *Main* folder page.

++++2. In the *Hosts* table, click the name of the host you want to assign a criticality to open the *Properties of host* page.

++++3. In the *Custom attributes* box, check *Criticality*, set it to *Business critical*.

++++4. Click *Save & view folder*.

Alternatively, you can assign the criticality to a folder of hosts (including all subfolders).
To do so, move your cursor to the top part of a folder icon and click the pen icon.
Proceed as before.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

This opens the *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dchangelog[Activate pending changes]* page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.

This step concludes the Define notifications based on host criticality topic.
