:description: Add the first host to your Checkmk site.

[#registration]
== Your agent registers with your site

The auto-registration of the installed agent might take a few minutes.
Once the registration is finished the host will automatically appear on the *All hosts* page that you are currently on.
You can check the status of the registration with the `cmk-agent-ctl status` command on the workstation you installed the agent on.

[#configure_alert]
== Next step: Configure an alert notification for your host

Congratulations you have successfully set up your first host!
In a next step you might want to set up an alert notification for your host.
In Checkmk, notification means that users are actively informed in the case of problems or other events in the monitoring.
