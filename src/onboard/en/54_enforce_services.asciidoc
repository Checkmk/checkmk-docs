:title: Enforce services
:description: In some cases, the automatic service discovery is not sufficient, and this is always the case when the absence of a process is the problem. However, to check whether, for example, a certain antivirus scanner is running on every Windows host or NTP on every Linux host, you can simply enforce those services.


[#define_service]
== Define the service
// TK: An example with State and count of processes/Windows Services would be better to show th differences to the Monitor Linux processes/Monitor Windows services topic

With the following example rule {CMK} will create an enforced service for time synchronization via network time protocol (NTP).
Note, that you find all enforced services rules in *Setup > Services > Enforced services*:

++++1. Click *Setup > Services > Enforced services > State of NTP time synchronisation* and then click *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fcsrf_token%3D00912545-1dea-4e77-851a-19d79cad7a4c%26filled_in%3Dnew_rule%26ruleset_back_mode%3Drulesets%26rule_folder%3D%26varname%3Dstatic_checks%253Antp_time%26mode%3Dnew_rule%26folder%3D%26_new_dflt_rule%3DSET[Add rule]*.

++++2. In the *Parameters* box, set *Check type* to *chrony- Chrony: NTP time synchronisation*.

Since no service discovery takes place, you must select here the check plug-in that creates the service(s).

++++3. In the *Conditions* box, make sure that this rule is applied to Linux hosts only.

++++4. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click the yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated:

image::onboarding_button_pending_changes.png[alt="Button on 'Setup' pages with number of pending changes."]

This opens the *link:/pass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fpass:[$$SITE_NAME$$]%2Fcheck_mk%2Fwato.py%3Fmode%3Dchangelog[Activate pending changes]* page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.


[#control_success]
== Control success

The enforced service defined in this way is added on all hosts to which this rule applies - without the need to run a service discovery.

The following service states for the new *NTP Time* service are possible:
The service is OK, if NTP is running and works as expected.
It is CRIT or UNKNOWN, if NTP does not run or has a problem.
The service is PEND, if the agent provides no information at all, e.g., because NTP is not even installed.
// In the last case the *Checkmk* service changes to WARN and shows the note that the relevant section in the agent data is missing.

This step concludes the Enforce services topic.
