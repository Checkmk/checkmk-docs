= Enforce services to get informed about absence services, e.g., virus scanner
:revdate: 2025-04-15
:title: Enforce services
:description: In some cases, the automatic service discovery is not sufficient, and this is always the case when the absence of a process is the problem. However, to check whether, for example, a certain antivirus scanner is running on every Windows host or NTP on every Linux host, you can simply enforce those services.


[#define_service]
== Define the service
// TK: An example with State and count of processes/Windows Services would be better to show th differences to the Monitor Linux processes/Monitor Windows services topic

With the following example rule Checkmk will create an enforced service for time synchronization via network time protocol (NTP).
Note, that you find all enforced services rules in *Setup > Services > Enforced services*:

++++1. Go to *Setup > Services > Enforced services > State of NTP time synchronisation* and then click *link:wato.py?filled_in=new_rule&ruleset_back_mode=rulesets&rule_folder=&varname=static_checks%3Antp_time&mode=new_rule&folder=&_new_dflt_rule=SET["Add rule", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Parameters* box, set *Check type* to *chrony- Chrony: NTP Time Synchronization*.

Since no service discovery takes place, here you must select the check plug-in that creates the service(s).

++++3. In the *Conditions* box, make sure that this rule is applied to Linux hosts only.

++++4. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click this link *link:wato.py?mode=changelog["Activate pending changes", window=main]*

This opens the activate changes page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.

[#control_success]
== Control success

The enforced service defined in this way is added on all hosts to which this rule applies -- without the need to run a service discovery.

The following states for the new *NTP Time* service are possible:
The service is OK, if NTP is running and works as expected.
It is CRIT or UNKNOWN, if NTP does not run or has a problem.
The service is PEND, if the agent provides no information at all, for example, when NTP is not even installed.
// In the last case the *Checkmk* service changes to WARN and shows the note that the relevant section in the agent data is missing.

This step concludes the Enforce services topic.
