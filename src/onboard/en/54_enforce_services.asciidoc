= Enforce services to get informed about absence services, e.g., virus scanner
:revdate: 2024-08-29
:title: Enforce services
:description: In some cases, the automatic service discovery is not sufficient, and this is always the case when the absence of a process is the problem. However, to check whether, for example, a certain antivirus scanner is running on every Windows host or NTP on every Linux host, you can simply enforce those services.


[#define_service]
== Define the service
// TK: An example with State and count of processes/Windows Services would be better to show th differences to the Monitor Linux processes/Monitor Windows services topic

With the following example rule {CMK} will create an enforced service for time synchronization via network time protocol (NTP).
Note, that you find all enforced services rules in *Setup > Services > Enforced services*:

++++1. Click *Setup > Services > Enforced services > State of NTP time synchronisation* and then click *link:wato.py?filled_in=new_rule&ruleset_back_mode=rulesets&rule_folder=&varname=static_checks%3Antp_time&mode=new_rule&folder=&_new_dflt_rule=SET["Add rule", window=main]*.

++++2. In the *Parameters* box, set *Check type* to *chrony- Chrony: NTP Time Synchronization*.

Since no service discovery takes place, here you must select the check plug-in that creates the service(s).

++++3. In the *Conditions* box, make sure that this rule is applied to Linux hosts only.

++++4. Click *Save*.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

++++1. Click this link *link:wato.py?mode=changelog["Activate pending changes", window=main]*

This opens the activate changes page.

++++2. Click *Activate on selected sites*.

[#control_success]
== Control success

The enforced service defined in this way is added on all hosts to which this rule applies -- without the need to run a service discovery.

The following states for the new *NTP Time* service are possible:
The service is OK, if NTP is running and works as expected.
It is CRIT or UNKNOWN, if NTP does not run or has a problem.
The service is PEND, if the agent provides no information at all, for example, when NTP is not even installed.
// In the last case the *Checkmk* service changes to WARN and shows the note that the relevant section in the agent data is missing.

This step concludes the Enforce services topic.
