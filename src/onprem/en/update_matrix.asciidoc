:title: Update matrix for version {v23}
:description: This article shows the Linux distribution versions supported by {CMK}. This will help you determine the order to update {CMK} on your Linux server.

[#intro]
== Introduction

With each version of {CMK}, previously-supported Linux versions are removed and new ones are added.
This may make it necessary to perform one or more xref:release_upgrade#[upgrades of your Linux distribution] before performing an update of {CMK}.
The graphics in this article will help you to determine the appropriate sequence.
Study these carefully before searching the link:https://checkmk.com/download/archive[download archive^] or requesting an older package.
If you want to update to a version of {CMK} older than {v23}, please read this article for the {CMK} version that is to be the _target_ of the update.

[#steps]
== Determining the required update steps

The task is now to move from the top left to the bottom right in the xref:matrix[compatibility matrix] for your particular Linux distribution.
The specifications for the xref:update#[Update of {CMK}] must be taken into account:

* No major version may be omitted.

* Before updating the major version, you must update to the highest patch version available for the major version.
The minimum requirements are described in the xref:update_major#update_patch[article on updating to {v23}].

* When upgrading the Linux distribution, exactly the same {CMK} version must be installed on the new distribution version as was present on the old one.

Linux distributors also generally set a requirement:

* Upgrades must not skip any version.

////
Ubuntu is somewhat special in this respect:
LTS versions (_Long Term Support_, five years of updates) should only ever be updated to the next LTS version,
STS versions (_Short Term Support_, nine months of updates) must be updated in half-yearly steps.
////

These requirements mean that you may only move in the graphic for your Linux distribution line by line or column by column -- _never_ diagonally -- and that jumps are only permitted if they do not violate the above requirements.

////
For an update from Debian 9 with {CMK} {v22}p1 to Debian 12 with {CMK} {v23}, this will result in the following update sequence:

. Under Debian 9, update {CMK} {v22}p1 xref:update#[to the current patch version] of {v22}.

. Upgrade from Debian 9 to 10, 11 and finally to 12 as described in the xref:release_upgrade#[Linux upgrade on the {CMK} server] article.

. On Debian 12, update the current patch version of {CMK} {v22} to the xref:update_major#[current patch version of {v23}].
////

[#matrix]
== Compatibility matrix

// The complete compatibility matrix will be available a few hours after the release of Checkmk {v23}.

The {CMK} version numbers at the top of the graphics in the following sections always indicate the version _from_ which a change has been made, i.e. a Linux version is newly supported or no longer supported.
An arrowhead at the end of a bar means that this {CMK} version is currently supported, i.e. further patch versions will follow.
A blunt end, on the other hand, indicates a combination of {CMK} version and distribution version that has reached its end of support.
This may be due to a discontinued {CMK} version (all bars are blunt) or a distribution that is no longer supported by the distributor (individual bars continue with arrowheads).
The graphics are created automatically from daily-updated data on the available downloads, so the publication date of this article does not necessarily reflect the actuality of the displayed data.

[#debian]
=== Debian

The support periods of the Debian versions can be found at link:https://wiki.debian.org/LTS[Debian-Wiki^] or an overview at link:https://endoflife.date/debian[endoflife.date^].

[#redhat]
=== RedHat Enterprise Linux

Red Hat provides a detailed overview of link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata[planned support periods^].
At endoflife.date you will find information on the binary compatible distributions link:https://endoflife.date/almalinux[AlmaLinux^], link:https://endoflife.date/centos[CentOS^], link:https://endoflife.date/oracle-linux[Oracle Linux^] and link:https://endoflife.date/rocky-linux[Rocky Linux^].

[#ubuntu]
=== Ubuntu

Note that STS versions of Ubuntu are no longer supported by {CMK} starting with {v23}.
However, we always make sure that an update is possible from every {CMK} version that was provided for an STS version up to the next LTS version.
As of {v22}, the xref:ossupport[OS support policy] creates clear rules.

Ubuntu itself maintains a link:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases[list^] sorted by versions still in support as well as discontinued versions.
The list at link:https://endoflife.date/ubuntu[endoflife.date^] is sorted by version release date.

[#ossupport]
== OS support policy in {CMK}

In order to provide an outlook for the support by future {CMK} versions and to be able to plan updates of distributions and {CMK} better, {comfull} has set itself some rules:
RHEL
* _Enterprise distributions_ (SLES, Red Hat Enterprise Linux) will be supported for up to 10 years after their release date, or until the official end of support by the distributor.
* _Community distributions_ (Debian, Ubuntu) are supported for up to 5 years after their release date, or until the official end of support by the distributor, provided they are LTS releases.

In both cases, the earlier point in time is decisive.

From the time of the release of a new {CMK} version we will strive to support every current distribution version for the entire product lifecycle of the new {CMK} version, unless there are technical reasons to preclude this, or the number of simultaneously-supported versions of a distribution exceeds four.
If this is the case, we reserve the right to no longer support the distribution version with the shortest remaining period of support.
This will be announced when a new {CMK} version is released.

Ubuntu STS versions are no longer supported since {CMK} {v23}.
This means that users of {CMK} {v22} on Ubuntu 23.10 must first perform the xref:release_upgrade#[operating system upgrade] to Ubuntu 24.04 staying on {CMK} {v22} before they can update {CMK} to {v23}.
