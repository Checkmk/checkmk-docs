[#intro]
== What is NagVis?

In the article on xref:monitoring_basics#parents[monitoring basics] you saw the map of a network's topology based on parent-child relations.
NagVis is responsible for such maps.
The extension enables a visualization of, for example, infrastructures, servers, ports or processes.

NagVis' mode of operation is basically very simple:
{CMK}, or to be more precise xref:glossar#livestatus[Livestatus], provides back-end data such as hosts, services, host groups and service groups.
These elements from your monitoring can be placed as icons on various maps.
These dynamic icons can then show the current state of each of the hosts and services.
More detailed additional information can be provided by tooltips.
And finally, the icons and other elements are also links to the {CMK} objects that they represent.
Other available elements are lines, performance displays (gadgets) and containers for external contents.

To get a better conception of what can be achieved with NagVis in {CMK}, here are three examples:

* Geographic maps based on link:https://www.openstreetmap.org/[OpenStreetMap^] for managing locations.
* Automatic topological maps from parent-child relations.
* Maps of individual switches or server rooms to enable an overview of ports and hardware.

Provided the xref:monitoring_basics#parents[parent-child relations] have been defined, without further action you can call up a map in {CMK} using [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > Parent / Child topology#.
Additional steps are unnecessary here.

[#setup]
== Setting-up NagVis

NagVis is fully-integrated in {CMK} and configured so that you can immediately begin adding elements from your monitoring to maps.

To start NagVis, first open the section with available snap-ins for the xref:glossar#sidebar[sidebar] via icon:button_sidebar_add_snapin[] at the bottom of the sidebar. 
Here select the [.guihint]#NagVis maps# snap-in, and finally start NagVis with the icon:button_view_snapin_edit[] button.

image::nagvis_snapin_nagvis.png[width=50%]

Before you create your first map you should have a look at the main configuration in [.guihint]#Options > General Configuration#.
Here can be found over 100 options for the basics, such as data formats and language settings, from the displaying of objects on maps, to the weighting of the available host and service states.

image::nagvis2_general_configuration.png[]

At this point we would like to do without a comprehensive description for the use of NagVis, and especially its configuration options.
NagVis itself has a very good, detailed link:https://www.nagvis.org/doc[documentation], in which also all options of the main configuration are explained.
In the following we will restrict ourselves to the most essential basics for generating simple, useful maps using NagVis in {CMK}.


[#maps]
== Creating maps

=== The various types of maps

NagVis provides a total of five different map types: regular, dynamic, automatic and interactive/non-interactive geographic maps.

* _Regular map_ is the standard type of map.
The map can visualize any desired scenario – from switch ports, to server rooms, to complete infrastructures.
The elements (icons, lines, etc.) are added individually to the maps from the inventories of the {CMK} hosts and services.

* _Dynamic map_ largely resembles the regular map, with a significant difference however:
hosts, services, host groups and service groups are not explicitly specified, but instead by using filters in the form of xref:regexes#[regular expressions];
to put it more accurately, in the form of valid xref:livestatus#[Livestatus] filters.
In this way new hosts and services, and likewise any alterations land automatically on the map without additional manual action being required.

* _Automap_ you have already met.
This is the network topology map mentioned xref:intro[at the start of this article] which is generated fully-automatically from the parent-child relations defined in {CMK}.

* _Geographical map_ is a map rendered with map material from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project for their backgrounds.


[#automap]
=== Creating an automap

The quickest facility for creating a representative map is the automap.
Create a new map of the [.guihint]#Automap based on parent/child relations# type via [.guihint]#Options > Manage Maps > Create Map#.
In [.guihint]#ID# enter the internal name `myautomap`, and in [.guihint]#Alias# your name `My Automap` for the display.

image::nagvis2_automap_create.png[]

The map itself will immediately appear in the content area, and its corresponding link will appear in the [.guihint]#NagVis maps# snap-in.
Automap-specific settings can next be customized in [.guihint]#Edit Map > Map Options > Automap#.
The [.guihint]#render_mode# entry is particularly interesting as it provides the fundamental layout of the nodes on the map.

image::nagvis2_automap_options.png[]

In addition the root of the map can be specified here –
although that is simpler to achieve with a right-click on an icon on the map, and then selecting the [.guihint]#Make root# context menu entry.

image::nagvis2_automap_contextmenu.png[]


[#regular_map]
=== Creating a regular map

Regular maps are the commonest maps in NagVis.
So that you can to get to know NagVis' procedures and its most important elements, we will show you how to create a small map of a server rack.
This will visualize a host on an individual background, and provide optical and acoustic warnings when the monitored host is not {OK}.

To create the map open the options via [.guihint]#Options > Manage Maps#.
Here in [.guihint]#Create Map# give the map the name `mymap` and the alias `My Map`.
For the [.guihint]#Map Type# select [.guihint]#Regular map# and confirm with the [.guihint]#Create# button.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_create.png[]

Next import an image of the rack being monitored as the background.
This is achieved using [.guihint]#Options > Manage Backgrounds#.
Select the local file and confirm with the [.guihint]#Upload# button.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_upload-background.png[]

Now the imported image must be defined as the background for the current map.
Call up the map options with [.guihint]#Edit Map > Map Options# and go to the [.guihint]#Appearance# tab.
Here activate the [.guihint]#map_image# option and select the desired image from the menu.
Do not save that right now – a setting from the maps options is still needed.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_background.png[]

Go to the [.guihint]#Obj. Defaults# tab.
Here you can activate the [.guihint]#label_show# option.
This option enables the host and service icons on the map to be labeled with their appropriate host/service names – otherwise the icons will only be identified via their tooltips.
Finally, save these settings.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_show-label.png[]

Now it is time to add the host.
Click on [.guihint]#Edit Map > Add Icon > host# and then with the cursor (which now appears as a cross) at the position on the map where the icon is to be placed -- at this point the [.guihint]#Create Object#-dialog will open.
In the [.guihint]#General# tab simply select the desired host from the drop-down menu in [.guihint]#host_name# and save.
If you operate multiple {CMK} xref:glossar#site[sites], an alternative data source can be used via [.guihint]#backend_id#.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_host_create.png[]

The icon is now positioned on the map, and it provides detailed information via a tooltip.
Clicking on the icon takes you directly to the host in {CMK} -- all of the objects positioned in NagVis are links to your {CMK} objects.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_host-hover.png[]

The edit mode needs to be activated to be able to move or edit an icon.
Right-click on the icon to open its context menu, and select [.guihint]#Unlock#.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_icon-menu_locked.png[]

Now you can move the icon, or again open the context menu.
Here a number of new options will be seen which will enable the object to be cloned, deleted or edited, or to xref:basics_ackn#[acknowledge] a problem directly from here by choosing the [.guihint]#Acknowledge# option.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_icon-menu_unlocked.png[]

Once the editing of a host/icon is complete, again open its context menu and select [.guihint]#Lock#.
By the way, with [.guihint]#Edit Map > Lock/Unlock all# the editing mode can also be activated and deactivated for the complete map.

You can now add further hosts to the map.
Adding services, host groups and service groups functions in a similar way.

To round things off, the map can be so configured that when loading, problems will be signaled by a warning sound and blinking host icons.
For this, call up [.guihint]#Edit Map > Map Options# and switch to the [.guihint]#Events# tab.
Here, at the top of the display, activate [.guihint]#event_on_load#, and at the bottom check the [.guihint]#event_sound# box to receive audible warnings.

image::nagvis2_regularmap_events.png[]


[#geographical_map]
=== Creating a geographical map

Geographical maps are available in two different forms:
The _interactive_ variant can be scrolled and zoomed in the way we know from Google Maps & Co., and is set automatically as background.
Objects that have been placed on such maps will appear on every subsequent map of the same type.
NagVis assumes that an object will always be found at a specific location regardless of the scale of the map.
So for example, a host located in Hamburg will appear on a world map as well as on a map of Germany and of course on a map of Hamburg.

NagVis ultimately views the various map sections and zoom levels only as _viewports_.
At any time viewports can be saved as a separate, new map.
Since viewports/maps can likewise be displayed as icons on maps, to some extent maps can be nested.
So for example, a map of Germany with its dependencies can be called-up, and then with a click a more detailed view of a state, and then as needed maps for a specific subsidiary, server room, and from there even to a map for an individual switch.

In contrast to manual navigation, using an interactive map is quicker and more convenient, and as well the individual maps are active so that for example, 
they can be displayed in parallel on separate monitors, or set for automatic rotation on a single monitor (more on this xref:rotate[later]).
Also important: in this way a summary of the related maps is thus available as a tooltip.
This also makes using them more intuitive for third parties since they do not have to click through hierarchies, or need to know where zooming is necessary.

The _non-interactive_ geographical maps must be fed with a CSV file containing the hosts and coordinates to be rendered.
There are no general pre-existing elements in this case.

In the link:https://www.nagvis.org/doc[Nagvis documentation^] the _interactive_ geographical maps are called _worldmaps_, and the _non-interactive_ variants are called _geomaps_.
Worldmaps were first added to the version 1.9 of NagVis.
// and until now only explained in the English documentation.

Example: create an interactive map for all of Germany, and to this link a new viewport for North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).
Create an interactive geographical map – a worldmap – with [.guihint]#Options > Manage Maps > Create Map#.
As [.guihint]#Map Type# select the [.guihint]#Geographical Map (interactive)# option – the ID (`mygeomap`) and Alias (`My Geographical Map`) can also be defined here.

image::nagvis2_geomap_create.png[]

Specify the map section which is desired as the overview, and save this view using [.guihint]#Edit Map > Viewport > Save view#.

image::nagvis2_geomap_save-view.png[]

Next zoom into the map until the desired detail for North Rhine-Westphalia is reached.
This time save the view with [.guihint]#Map > Viewport > Save as new map# as the new map `mygeomap_nrw`.

image::nagvis2_geomap_save-viewport.jpeg[]

The map's alias will be adopted from the original map, so that you now have two maps named [.guihint]#My Geographical Map# in the navigation bar on the left.
Therefore now define a new alias `My Geographical Map NRW` with [.guihint]#Edit Map > Map Options#.

image::nagvis2_geomap_vieport-alias.jpeg[]

Switch to the Germany map [.guihint]#My Geographical Map# and add the link to the North Rhine-Westphalia map with [.guihint]#Edit Map > Add Icon > Map#.
In the subsequent [.guihint]#Create Object# dialog you only need to select the [.guihint]#mygeomap_nrw# map from the [.guihint]#map_name# menu.

image::nagvis2_geomap_map-icon_create.png[]

Afterwards a click on the new icon in the Germany map takes you directly to the North Rhine-Westphalia map.
In the same way additional maps can be linked together, and of course a navigation from the North Rhine-Westphalia map back to the Germany map can also be built-in.

image::nagvis2_geomap_map-link.png[]

The actual loading of the map contents also corresponds with the procedure for the other map types.
But remember – all objects that you add to _one_ of the worldmaps will also appear on _every other_ worldmap since they are really only alternative views of the real geographic situation.


[#dynamic_map]
=== Creating a dynamic map

Dynamic maps differ from the regular maps – as mentioned earlier – in the method of adding their elements.
Instead of manual additions the dynamic maps receive their elements – hosts, services, host groups and service groups - dynamically via Livestatus filters.
As an example, a map should automatically receive the [.guihint]#CPU load# services from all hosts.

To create such a map, again begin with [.guihint]#Options > Manage Maps > Create Map#, and allocate an ID (`mydynamicmap`) and alias (`My Dynamic Map`).

image::nagvis2_dynmap_create.png[]

Next open the map options with [.guihint]#Edit Map > Map Options# and select the [.guihint]#Dynmap# tab.
Here activate the [.guihint]#dynmap_object_types# option and choose the services as the object type.

The interesting part now follows with the second option [.guihint]#dynmap_object_filter#, with which the filter for the services is defined.
Use the simple xref:livestatus#[Livestatus query] `Filter: description ~ CPU load\n`.
With this the string `CPU load` will be searched for in the `description` column.
This `\n` does not belong to the filter itself, rather it generates a line-break required by the Livestatus query constructed by the filter.

image::nagvis2_dynmap_options_filter.png[]

If you now save, all of your monitoring's [.guihint]#CPU load# services will land on the map.
As well, any new objects in the monitoring which match the filter will be added automatically to the map.

image::nagvis2_dynmap_auto-icons.png[]

In the NagVis documentation it is also described how the configuration functions directly by using the configuration files.

*By the way:* since dynamic maps can also be saved as static maps with [.guihint]#Actions > Export to static map#, this method can be used as a beginner's help to create static maps containing very many elements.


[#customizing]
== Customizing maps

[#lines]
=== Lines

NagVis provides various types of lines:
there are purely decorative lines without further functions under [.guihint]#Edit Map > Add Special > Stateless Line#,
lines which visualize hosts and services with 'traffic light colors' in the same way as for icons, and the _weathermap lines_.
These last visualize network bandwidths using seven distinct colors.
To create a weathermap line proceed as follows:

Start with [.guihint]#Edit Map > Add Line > Service# and select a host and a network interface in the [.guihint]#Create Object# dialog.

image::nagvis2_lines_create.png[]

Next, switch to the [.guihint]#Appearance# tab and set the [.guihint]#view_type# to [.guihint]#line#.
As [.guihint]#line_type# activate the `pass:[--%+BW-><-%+BW--]` entry.
With this lines will be generated for upload and download and they will include labels for percentage (`%`) and absolute (`BW`) bandwidth.

image::nagvis2_lines_line-type.png[]

Once saved the lines will appear on the map.
Clicking on the 'lock' icon in the middle allows the end points as well as the middle point of the line to be moved.

image::nagvis2_lines_weatherlines.png[]

NagVis also provides a default legend:
using [.guihint]#Edit Map > Add Special > Shape# insert a so-called _shape_ – simply an image in NagVis.
In the [.guihint]#icon# option choose the image [.guihint]#demo_traffic_load_legend.png# from the drop-down menu.

image::nagvis2_lines_weatherlines_result.png[]


[#gadgets]
=== Gadgets

Gadgets, like lines and icons are aids to visualization on a map.
They show performance data in the form of speedometers, thermometers or similar.
Consequently these are only available for services.
As an example, the load on a network interface can be created in the style of a speedometer:

Add a service as an icon to your map using [.guihint]#Edit Map > Add Icon > Service#.
In the [.guihint]#General# tab choose a host and a suitable network interface as the service.

Switch to the [.guihint]#Appearance# tab and set [.guihint]#view_type# to [.guihint]#gadget#.
Directly below, activate [.guihint]#gadget_url#.
Here there are a number of display variations which correspond to the files in `~/share/nagvis/htdocs/userfiles/gadgets/`.
Select [.guihint]#std_speedometer.php# for the speedometer display.

image::nagvis2_gadget_speedometer.png[]


[#container_iframes]
=== Container/iframes

An interesting possibility for showing external information is provided by _containers_.
Here you can simply specify a URL and allow the target to be displayed in an iframe.
As an example, a host group view restricted purely to the table should serve as an xref:views#embed_views[embedded view].

Add a container to your map using [.guihint]#Edit Map > Add Special > Container#.
In contrast to host and service icons, here you can not simply click on the map, rather you must draw a frame.
This can of course be modified at any later time.
A dialog with options will again open.

In the [.guihint]#General# tab set the [.guihint]#view_type# to [.guihint]#iframe#.
The actual work is in the [.guihint]#url# option:
The base URL can be gotten with icon:button_frameurl[] on the page of the host group view.
The options for the xref:views#embed_views[embedded view] must then be added with which only the table is actually displayed (plus a bit of background).
Thus the URL can look something like this:

`/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=hostgroups&display_options=tbdezocf`

The exact fitting and positioning of the container is also done in the [.guihint]#General# tab by entering the coordinates as well as the height and width.
If you want to open the context menu of an iframe container, you must place the mouse cursor directly over the edge so that it changes its shape for scaling.

image::nagvis_modify_container.png[]


[#rotate]
=== Making maps rotate

On NagVis' overview page you may have noticed the [.guihint]#Rotations# entry at the lower left of the navigation bar, or respectively the list of maps under [.guihint]#Rotation Pools# in the center.
Maps can be set to rotate automatically at any desired interval, which for example is practical for publicly-visible information monitors.

You can configure this in the NagVis configuration file `~/etc/nagvis/nagvis.ini.php`.
Open this file and scroll to line 448, where you will find the `Rotation pool definitions`.

Here three lines are required to define a rotation pool, the appropriate maps, and the interval
-- in the below example the pool `myrotation` with the maps `mymap1`, `mymap2` and `mymap3`, and with an interval of 30 seconds:

.~/etc/nagvis/nagvis.ini.php
[{file}]
----
[rotation_myrotation]
maps="mymap1,mymap2,mymap3"
interval=30
----
