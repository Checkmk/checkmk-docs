== Introduction

link:https://nagstamon.de/[Nagstamon^] is a small desktop tool that was originally developed for monitoring systems with Livestatus.
In today's version, the client also supports {CMK}.
It translates a {CMK} xref:glossar.html#view[view] in a very compact form and summarizes the problems.

Even though there is no official support for Nagstamon, we still want to make the connection as easy as possible.
Below we describe how to connect Nagstamon with {CMK}.


== Configuration

The simplest method is to connect Nagstamon directly to the {CMK} web interface.
To ensure that this integration works seamlessly, {CMK} delivers two special views, which Nagstamon then uses as a data source:

* `nagstamon_hosts`
* `nagstamon_svc`

Thus you do not have to initially set up any views to enable the integration.
When you start Nagstamon for the first time, you will be directly asked for a server -- 
otherwise you can also set up a new server in the menu via the [.guihint]#Settings# menu item, 
where you can create a new connection via [.guihint]#New server ...#.

In the dialog that appears, select the [.guihint]#{CMK} Multisite# entry under [.guihint]#Monitor type#, 
assign a human-readable name and enter the URL of the connection in the [.guihint]#Monitor URL# field.

*Important:* You can only authenticate here with a regular user -- 
an automation user does not work in this case!

A configuration can then look like this, for example:

image::nagstamon-server.png[width=400]

You can then use the [.guihint]#Show more options# option for fine-tuning 
and if you have configured your own views here, change to them.


== Diagnostic options

If, contrary to expectations, problems nevertheless arise, first check whether you can go open the following pages from the device on which Nagstamon is running.
Replace the placeholders with their real values:

* `\https://mon.mydomain.org/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=nagstamon_hosts`
* `\https://mon.mydomain.org/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=nagstamon_svc`

If this does not work -- using the login data that you have specified in the configuration -- 
you will receive a meaningful error message about what went wrong.
As soon as the call works correctly, Nagstamon should also supply data.
