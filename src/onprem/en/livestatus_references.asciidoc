[#tables]
== Available tables

The following tables are available for use in Livestatus.
Some of them additionally function over the columns of another table.
These columns will be identified by the table's name as a prefix:

[cols="25,~",options="header"]
|===
|Table |Comments
|`hosts` |Contains all information for the configured hosts.
|`services` |Contains all information for the configured services, and additionally the columns from `hosts`.
|`hostgroups` |Information for the host groups.
|`servicegroups` |Information for the service groups.
|`contactgroups` |Information for the contact groups.
|`servicesbygroup` |As for `services`, but additionally with the columns from `servicegroups`.
|`servicesbyhostgroup` |Like `services`, but additionally with the columns from `hostgroups`.
|`hostsbygroup` |Like `hosts`, but additionally with the columns from `hostgroups`.
|`contacts` |Information for the contacts.
|`commands` |All configured check commands, as found for a service under [.guihint]#Service check command#.
|`timeperiods` |All information for the configured time periods.
|`downtimes` |As for `timeperiods`, but for scheduled downtimes.
|`comments` |Contains all information for comments, and in addition the columns from `hosts` and `services`.
|`log` |All information for logged events. These should be filtered by class and time stamp/time period.
|`status` |Information for the core's status and performance.
|`columns` |All available tables will be listed here. Additionally, a description of all of a table's columns is also provided.
|`statehist` |The past-statuses for a host/service can be comprehensively searched with this table.
|`eventconsoleevents` |Lists all of the xref:glossar#ec[Event Console]'s events. This table additionally has all columns from `hosts`.
|`eventconsolehistory` |Like `eventconsoleevents`, but also with additional columns for an event's history.
|`eventconsolestatus` |Lists statistics from the performance of the Event Console.
|`eventconsolerules` |Statistics for how often the rule-matching for an incoming event was successful.
|===

Should you wish to know which columns a table uses, these can be easily shown with the following command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} lq "GET columns\nColumns: name\nFilter: table = columns"
description
name
table
type
----

Other tables can also be selected by using filters.
All of the columns available for searching by column and table can be seen in the output from the example shown.


[#hdr]
== Available headers

[cols="20,15,~",options="header"]
|===
|Header |Argument |Function
|`Columns` |Column name |Restricts the output to the specified columns.
|`Filter` |Column name, operator and object name |Restricts the output to the defined object. See also xref:filter[filter].
|`OrderBy` |Column name or dictionary key |Sorts the output by the content of the column or the value respectively. Default sort order is ascending, alternatively you can additionally specify one out of  `asc` or `desc`.
|`OR` |Integer |Links the last `n` filter(s) with a logical OR.
|`AND` |Integer |Links the last `n` filter(s) with a logical AND.
|`NEGATE` |Integer |Inverts the last `n` filter(s).
|`Separators` |ASCII-values |Defines the characters for separating elements.
|`OutputFormat` |Name |Defines an alternative output format for the data. Possible formats are `json`, `python`, `python3`, `CSV` and `csv` (the standard format).
|`Stats` |Operator and column names |Generates statistics for specified columns.
|`StatsOr` |Integer |Provides the `OR`-header's functions in the statistics.
|`StatsAnd` |Integer |Provides the `AND`-header's functions in the statistics.
|`StatsNegate` |Integer |Provides the `NEGATE`-header's functions in the statistics.
|`Limit` |Integer |Limits the output to `n` lines.
|`Timelimit` |Integer |Restricts the time allowed for processing the query to `n` seconds.
|`ColumnHeaders` |- |The first line of the output contains the name of the column used. If the header `ResponseHeader` has additionally been set, the column name will be output in the second line.
|`AuthUser` |Username |Restricts the output to the lines that the specified user is authorized to see.
|`WaitObject` |Object Name |The object for which a specified behavior is expected. This is the object's name, or respectively in the case of the `services` table, the host's name followed by a blank character, followed in turn by the service description. If the host name itself contains blank characters the two elements can also be separated by a semicolon. This header is only supported by the `hosts`, `services`, `hostgroups`, `servicegroups`, `contacts` and `contactgroups` tables.
|`WaitCondition` |Filter condition |The condition that must be satisfied for the defined object. Any desired number of conditions can be defined – these are linked together with a logical AND.
|`WaitConditionOr` |Integer |Provides the `OR`-header function in the Wait-conditions.
|`WaitConditionAnd` |Integer |Provides the `AND`-header function in the Wait-conditions.
|`WaitConditionNegate` |Integer |Provides the `NEGATE`-header function in the Wait-conditions.
|`WaitTrigger` |Keyword * |Keywords work like a normal condition if they are set by themselves. In combination with the `WaitCondition` this simplifies the  locating of relevant log entries and reduces the overhead in Livestatus.
|`WaitTimeout` |Integer |Sets a time limit in milliseconds. Following, for example, 5000 Milliseconds (5 seconds), the query will be executed even if the condition has not been satisfied.
|`Localtime` |Unix Time |By using a specified reference time it is attempted to compensate for differing local time stamps in a distributed environment.
|`ResponseHeader` |fixed16/off |Returns a status line in the first line of the response. The output itself remains in the first line if the header `ColumnHeaders` has additionally been set.
|`KeepAlive` |on |Prevents the Livestatus-channel being closed following a query.
|===

pass:[*] The following keywords are available for the `WaitTrigger`:

* check
* state
* log
* downtime
* comment
* command
* program
* all


[#filter]
