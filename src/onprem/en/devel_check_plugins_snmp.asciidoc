[#intro]
== Introduction

Check plug-ins that work with SNMP are developed in a similar way to their xref:devel_check_plugins#[agent-based relatives].
The difference lies both in the xref:glossar#service_discovery[service discovery] process and in the check itself.
With the agent-based check plug-ins, the xref:glossar#agent_plugin[agent plug-in] is used to determine which data is _sent_ to the {CMK} site, and pre-filtering (but no evaluation) often already takes place on the host.
In contrast, with SNMP you must specify exactly which data fields you require and explicitly _request_ these.
With SNMP, these areas (branches of a tree) or individual data fields (leaves) are identified by OIDs (object identifiers).

A complete transfer of all data would theoretically be possible (using the so-called _SNMP walk_),
However, even with fast devices this takes minutes, and with complex switches it can take over an hour.
This is therefore already a problem during a discovery and even more so during the check itself.
Here {CMK} takes a more targeted approach.
Nevertheless, SNMP walks are available in {CMK} for debugging existing checks and developing your own checks.

If you do not yet have experience with SNMP, we recommend that you read the article on xref:snmp#[Monitoring via SNMP].


[#snmp_special]
=== What works differently in SNMP?

Compared to a check plug-in for the {CMK} agent, there are some special features to note with SNMP.
With a check plug-in for SNMP, a service discovery is divided into two phases.

As a first step, the *SNMP detection* function is used to detect the device.
This serves to determine whether the check plug-in is of any interest to the respective device and is carried out for every device that is monitored via SNMP.
For this purpose, a few OIDs are retrieved -- individual ones, without an SNMP walk.
The most important of these is the `sysDescr` (OID: `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0`).
Under this OID, each SNMP device provides a description of itself, for example `Flintstones, Inc. Fred Router rev23`.

In the second step, the necessary monitoring data is retrieved for each of these candidates using SNMP walks.
These are then summarized in a table and provided to the check plug-in's *discovery function* in the `section` argument, which then determines the items to be monitored.
A xref:glossar#service[service] is then generated for each of these items.

During the *check* it is then already known whether the plug-in should be executed for the device and thus a new SNMP detection is not necessary.
The current monitoring data required for the plug-in is retrieved here via SNMP walks.

So what do you have to do differently with a check plug-in for SNMP compared to an agent-based one?

. You do _not_ need an xref:glossar#agent_plugin[agent plug-in].

. You define the OIDs required for SNMP detection and the texts they should contain.

. You decide which branches and leaves of the SNMP tree need to be fetched for monitoring.


[#mibs]
=== Don't be afraid of MIBs!

In this brief introduction we would like to discuss the notorious SNMP MIBs, about which there are many prejudices.
The good news:
{CMK} does not need MIBs!
However, they can be an important aid when _developing_ a check plug-in or _troubleshooting_ existing check plug-ins.

What are MIBs?
MIB literally means _Management Information Base,_ which contains little more information than the abbreviation itself.
Basically, an MIB is a human-readable text file that describes the branches and leaves in an SNMP data tree.

OIDs can identify branches or leaves.
The branch description contains information on the system and subsystem information provided by the branch.
If an OID references a leaf, the information in the MIB contains information on the data type (character string, fixed-point number, hex string, ...), the value range and the representation.
For example, temperatures can be stored as a fixed-point number with a sign on the Celsius scale with a resolution of 0.1° or without a sign in steps of 1.0° on the Kelvin scale.

{CMK} provides a series of freely accessible MIB files.
These describe very general fields in the global OID tree, but do not contain any manufacturer-specific fields.
They are therefore not much help for self-developed check plug-ins.

So try to find the relevant MIB files for your specific device somewhere on the manufacturer's website or even on the device's management interface.
Install these files in the {CMK} site in the `~/local/share/snmp/mibs/` directory.
You can then translate OID numbers into names using SNMP walks and thus more quickly find the data of interest for purposes of monitoring.
As already mentioned, well-maintained MIBs also contain interesting information in their comments.
You can easily view a MIB file with a text editor or the pager `less`.


[#locating_oids]
== Finding the correct OIDs

The crucial prerequisite for developing an SNMP-based check plug-in is that you know which OIDs contain the relevant information.
For the example scenario presented, we have assumed that you have just commissioned a batch of routers of the type _Flintstones, Inc. Fred Router rev23_.
You will often come across this fictitious device in manufacturer documentation and MIB comments.
However, you have forgotten to enter the contact and location information for some devices.
A self-written check plug-in for {CMK} should now help to identify these devices.

[TIP]
====
The example plug-in we have prepared is written in such a way that you can run it with almost any SNMP-capable device.
You only need to adapt the character string to be compared.
If you do not have a device at hand, you will find various simulation options in the chapter on xref:simulation[Troubleshooting].
====

The first step is to carry out a complete SNMP walk.
This involves retrieving _all_ of the available data via SNMP.
This can be done very easily for you with {CMK}.
First include the device for which you want to develop a check plug-in xref:snmp#add_device[in the monitoring].
Make sure that it can be monitored xref:snmp#services[in the basic functions].
At the very least, the [.guihint]#SNMP Info# and [.guihint]#Uptime# services must be found and probably also at least one [.guihint]#Interface#.
This will ensure that the SNMP access works properly.

Then switch to the {CMK} site's command line.
Here you can execute a complete walk with the following command -- in the following example for the device with the host name `mydevice01`.
We recommend that you also use the `-v` option (for _verbose_):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -v --snmpwalk mydevice01
mydevice01:
Walk on ".1.3.6.1.2.1"...3898 variables.
Walk on ".1.3.6.1.4.1"...6025 variables.
Wrote fetched data to /omd/sites/mysite/var/check_mk/snmpwalks/mydevice01.
----

As already mentioned, a complete SNMP walk can take minutes or even hours (even if the latter is a rare occurrence), so don't get nervous if it takes a while to complete.
The walk's results is saved in the `~/var/check_mk/snmpwalks/mydevice01` file.
This is a text file that is easy to read and starts like this:

.~/var/check_mk/snmpwalks/mydevice01
[{file}]
----
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 Flintstones, Inc. Fred Router rev23
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 .1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.2.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 546522419
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 barney@example.com
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 big-router-01
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 Server room 23, Stonestreet 52, Munich
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0 72
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8.0 0
----

Each line contains an OID and then its value.
You will find the most important one in the very first line, namely `sysDescr`.
This should be a unique identifier for a hardware model.

The second line is also interesting:
Below `1.3.6.1.4.1` there are branches that hardware manufacturers can assign themselves, here _Flintstones, Inc._ has the fictitious manufacturer ID `424242`.
Below this, the company has assigned `2` for routers and `3` for the same model.
You will then find device-specific OIDs within this branch.

These OIDs are however not very meaningful.
If the correct MIBs are installed, you can translate these into names in a second step.
It is best to redirect the output from the following command, which would otherwise be displayed in the terminal, to a file:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --snmptranslate mydevice01 > /tmp/translated
----

Once this file has been `translated` it reads like the original walk, but additionally shows the name of the OID in each line after the `--&gt;`:

./tmp/translated
[{file},highlight=4]
----
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 Flintstones, Inc. Fred Router rev23 --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 .1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.2.3 --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 546522419 --> DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 barney@example.com --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 big-router-01 --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 Server room 23, Stonestreet 52, Munich --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0 42 --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8.0 27 --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysORLastChange.0
----

In the above output, for example, the OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0` has the value `barney@example.com` and the name `SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0`.
The additional information showing the names of the OIDs provides important information for identifying the OIDs of interest.
For the example presented, the OIDs `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0` to `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0` are sufficient.


[#simple_snmp_plugin]
== Writing a simple check plug-in

You have now completed the preparatory work:
Now you have a list of the OIDs that you want to read and evaluate.
The task now is to use these notes to teach {CMK} which services are generated and when they should go to {WARN} or {CRIT}.
The programming of a check plug-in in Python used for this has many parallels to an xref:devel_check_plugins#write_check_plugin[agent-based check plug-in].
As there are some subtleties to consider, we will show the complete structure with all of the functions that are used.


[#scaffold]
=== Preparing the file

For your own check plug-ins you will find the base directory already prepared in the `local` hierarchy of the xref:cmk_commandline#sitedir[site directory].
This is `~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/`.
The directory belongs to the site user and is therefore writable for you.

In this directory, the plug-ins are organized in _plug-in families_, whose directory names can be freely chosen.
For example, all plug-ins relating to Cisco devices are stored in the `cisco` folder -- or all plug-ins relating to routers from the manufacturer `Flintstones, Inc.` are stored in the `flintstone` folder.

In this subdirectory `<plug-in_family>`, further subdirectories with predefined names are then created as required for the various APIs, e.g. `agent_based` for the Check API of agent-based plug-ins, including SNMP-based check plug-ins.

Create the two subdirectories for the new check plug-in and then switch to them to work:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkdir -p ~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based
{c-omd} cd ~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based
----

Create the file `flintstone_setup_check.py` for the check plug-in here.
The convention is that the file name reflects the name of the check plug-in as it is defined when the check plug-in is created as an instance of the `CheckPlugin` class.
It is _mandatory_ that the file ends with `.py`, because from {CMK} version {v20} the check plug-ins are always real Python modules.

An executable basic framework (link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk-docs/blob/master/examples/devel_check_plugins_snmp/flintstone_setup_check_bare_minimum.py[Download at GitHub^]), which you will expand step by step in the following, looks like this:

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from cmk.agent_based.v2 import (
    CheckPlugin,
    CheckResult,
    startswith,
    DiscoveryResult,
    Result,
    Service,
    SimpleSNMPSection,
    SNMPTree,
    State,
    StringTable,
)

def parse_flintstone(string_table):
    return {}

def discover_flintstone(section):
    yield Service()

def check_flintstone(section):
    yield Result(state=State.OK, summary="Everything is fine")

snmp_section_flintstone_setup = SimpleSNMPSection(
    name = "flintstone_base_config",
    parse_function = parse_flintstone,
    detect = startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "Flintstone"),
    fetch = SNMPTree(base='.1.3.6.1.2.1.1', oids=['4.0']),
)

check_plugin_flintstone_setup = CheckPlugin(
    name = "flintstone_setup_check",
    sections = [ "flintstone_base_config" ],
    service_name = "Flintstone setup check",
    discovery_function = discover_flintstone,
    check_function = check_flintstone,
)
----

First you will need to import the functions and classes required for the check plug-ins from Python modules.
We advise against the occasionally used `import pass:[*]`, as it makes unnecessary use of memory and obscures which namespaces are actually made available.
For our example, we will only import what will be required or may be useful in the rest of this article:

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
from cmk.agent_based.v2 import (
    CheckPlugin,
    CheckResult,
    startswith,
    DiscoveryResult,
    Result,
    Service,
    SimpleSNMPSection,
    SNMPTree,
    State,
    StringTable,
)
----

In comparison with the xref:devel_check_plugins#scaffold[agent-based check plug-in], the SNMP-specific new functions and classes stand out: `SNMPTree`, `SimpleSNMPSection` and `startswith`.
Self-explanatory is `SNMPTree`, which is a class for displaying SNMP trees.
The class `SimpleSNMPSection` is used to create an SNMP section.
The function `startswith()` compares the content of an SNMP leaf with a character string.
More on this later.


[#snmp_section]
=== Creating the SNMP section

After you have identified the xref:locating_oids[correct OIDs], it's time to actually develop the check plug-in.
When creating the SNMP section, you specify two things:

. You identify the devices for which the check plug-in is to be executed. +
In the following example, this is done with the `startswith()` function, which compares a character string with the start of the content of an OID leaf.
Further assignment options are shown below.

. You declare which OID branches or leaves are to be retrieved for monitoring. +
This is done with the constructor of the `SNMPTree` class.

Extend the prepared example file so that the plug-in is only executed for a small number of devices, here the `Flintstones, Inc. Fred Router` models.
The OIDs for _contact_, _device name_ and _location_ are then retrieved for these devices.
These three OIDs are provided by each device.
If you want to test the example with real SNMP-capable devices, it is therefore sufficient to customize the model name to be recognized.

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
snmp_section_flintstone_setup_check = SimpleSNMPSection(
    name = "flintstone_base_config",
    parse_function = parse_flintstone,
    detect = startswith(
        ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0",
        "Flintstones, Inc. Fred Router",
    ),
    fetch = SNMPTree(
        base = '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1',
        oids = ['4.0', '5.0', '6.0'],
    ),
)
----

The example also contains the `name` parameter with which the generated SNMP section is identified and a parse function, which we will discuss xref:parse_function[later].


[#detect]
==== The SNMP detection

Use the `detect` parameter to specify the conditions under which the discovery function should be executed.
In our example, this is the case if the value of the OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0` (i.e. the `sysDescr`) begins with the text `Flintstones, Inc. Fred Router` (case-insensitive).
In addition to `startswith`, there is a whole range of other possible functions for identification.
There is also a negated form of each, which begins with `not_`.
Note that each function must be separately specified in the `import` statement.

[cols="25,~,25",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Function |Negation
|`equals(oid, "needle")` |The value of the OID matches the text `needle`. |`not_equals(oid, "needle")`
|`contains(oid, "needle")` |The value of the OID contains the text `needle` at some point. |`not_contains(oid, "needle")`
|`startswith(oid, "needle")` |The value of the OID begins with the text `needle`. |`not_startswith(oid, "needle")`
|`endswith(oid, "needle")` |The value of the OID ends with the text `needle`. |`not_endswith(oid, "needle")`
|`matches(oid, regex)` |The value of the OID corresponds to the xref:regexes#[regular expression] `regex`, anchored after and before, i.e. with an exact match. If you only need a substring, simply add a `pass:[.*]` to the start or end. |`not_matches(oid, regex)`.
|`exists(oid)` |The OID is available on the device. Its value may be empty. |`not_exists(oid)`
|===

There is also the option of linking several attributes with `all_of` or `any_of`.

`all_of` requires several successful checks for positive recognition.
The following example assigns your check plug-in to a device if the text in the `sysDescr` begins with `foo` (or `FOO` or `Foo`) *and*
the OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0` contains the text `.4.1.11863.`:

[{python}]
----
detect = all_of(
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo"),
    contains(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0", ".4.1.11863.")
)
----

In contrast, `any_of` is satisfied if only one of the criteria has been met.
Here is an example in which different values are permitted for the `sysDescr`:

[{python}]
----
detect = any_of(
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo version 3 system"),
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo version 4 system"),
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo version 4.1 system"),
)
----

By the way: Are you familiar with xref:regexes#[regular expressions]?
If so, you could probably simplify this example and get by with just a single line:

[{python}]
----
detect = matches(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "FOO Version (3|4|4.1) .*")
----

And another important note:
The OIDs that you pass to the SNMP detection for a check plug-in are retrieved from *every* device that is monitored via SNMP.
This is the only way {CMK} can determine which devices the check plug-in should be applied to.

You should therefore be very careful when using manufacturer-specific OIDs.
Try to design your SNMP detection to prioritize that the `sysDescr` (`1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0`) and the `sysObjectID` (`1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0`) are checked first.

If you still need a different OID for exact identification, use `all_of()` and proceed as follows:

. First check for `sysDescr` or `sysObjectID`.

. In further arguments, you can then further restrict the group of devices for which your plug-in is to be executed.


[{python}]
----
detect = all_of(
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "Flintstone"),   # first check sysDescr
    contains(".1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.2.3.37.0", "foo"),  # fetch vendor specific OID
)
----

This works thanks to the _lazy evaluation_ principle:
As soon as one of the earlier checks fails, no further checks will be performed.
In the example above, the OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.2.3.37.0` is only retrieved from devices that also have `Flintstone` in their `sysDescr`.


[#parse_function]
=== Writing the parse function

As with xref:devel_check_plugins.html#parse_function[agent-based plug-ins], the parse function in the SNMP-based check plug-in also has the task of converting the received agent data into a form that can be processed easily and, above all, with high performance.

You also receive the data here as a list.
However, there are a few subtleties to consider, as it makes a difference whether you are querying leaves or branches.
As a reminder -- in our xref:snmp_section[above example], leaves are requested:

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
    fetch = SNMPTree(
        base = '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1',
        oids = ['4.0', '5.0', '6.0'],
    )
----

If you temporarily extend the parse function with the `print()` function, you can display the data that {CMK} provides from this query when xref:test[testing the check plug-in]:

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
def parse_flintstone(string_table):
    print(string_table)
    return {}
----

You will receive a nested list which contains only one element in its first level, namely a list of the retrieved values:

[{python}]
----
[
    ['barney@example.com', 'big-router-01', 'Server room 23, Stonestreet 52, Munich']
]
----

The result looks a little different if you retrieve branches that contain multiple leaves.
Assume that the router can be equipped with a variable number of network cards whose name, connection status and speed can be read below `1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.2.3.23` &#8230;

[{python}]
----
    fetch = SNMPTree(
        base = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.2.3.23',
        oids = [
            '6', # all names
            '7', # all states
            '8', # all speeds
        ],
    )
----

&#8230; then the two-dimensional list could possibly look like this:

[{python}]
----
[
    # Name, State, Speed
    ['net0', '1', '1000'],
    ['net1', '0', '100'],
    ['net2', '1', '10000'],
    ['net3', '1', '1000'],
]
----

All leaves available under an OID are written to a table column.
It should therefore be obvious that for the purposes of displaying the data, only matching OIDs may be queried.

[TIP]
====
The last example shown for retrieving OID branches is also a part of our link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk-docs/blob/master/examples/devel_check_plugins_snmp/flintstones_fred_router.txt[SNMP walk^] provided on GitHub, which you can use for xref:simulation[simulations].
====

But now back to the example in which the OID leaves for contact, device name and location are queried:
The following parse function simply copies each element of the inner list into a key-value pair in the returned dictionary:

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
def parse_flintstone(string_table):
    # print(string_table)
    result = {}
    result["contact"] = string_table[0][0]
    result["name"] = string_table[0][1]
    result["location"] = string_table[0][2]
    # print(result)
    return result
----

The result from the parse function will then look like this:

[{python}]
----
{
    'contact': 'barney@example.com',
    'name': 'big-router-01',
    'location': 'Server room 23, Stonestreet 52, Munich'
}
----


[#check_plug-in]
=== Creating the check plug-in

A check plug-in is created exactly as described in xref:devel_check_plugins#check_plug-in[agent-based check plug-ins].

Since in most cases you will be querying several SNMP branches and this will result in several SNMP sections, the `sections` parameter with the list of sections to be evaluated is usually required:

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
check_plugin_flintstone_setup = CheckPlugin(
    name = "flintstone_setup_check",
    sections = [ "flintstone_base_config" ],
    service_name = "Flintstone setup check",
    discovery_function = discover_flintstone,
    check_function = check_flintstone,
)
----


[#discovery_function]
=== Writing the discovery function

The discovery function also corresponds to the example for xref:devel_check_plugins#discovery_function[agent-based check plug-ins].
For check plug-ins that only generate one service per host, a single `yield()` is sufficient:

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
def discover_flintstone(section):
    yield Service()
----


[#check_function]
=== Writing the check function

In the example, we want to check whether the contact, device name and location information is available.
It is therefore sufficient to check which fields are empty in the check function and accordingly set the status to {CRIT} (if something is missing) or to {OK} (if everything is available):

.~/local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/flintstone/agent_based/flintstone_setup_check.py
[{python}]
----
def check_flintstone(section):
    missing = 0
    for e in ["contact", "name", "location"]:
        if section[e] == "":
            missing += 1
            yield Result(state=State.CRIT, summary=f"Missing information: {e}!")
    if missing > 0:
        yield Result(state=State.CRIT, summary=f"Missing fields: {missing}!")
    else:
        yield Result(state=State.OK, summary="All required information is available.")
----

Once the check function has been created, the check plug-in will be ready for use.

We have made this complete check plug-in available at link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk-docs/blob/master/examples/devel_check_plugins_snmp/flintstone_setup_check.py[GitHub^].


[#test]
=== Testing and activating the check plug-in

Testing and activation are carried out in the same way as for an xref:devel_check_plugins#test[agent-based check plug-in].

The first step is the service discovery for the plug-in:

[{shell},highlight=11-13]
----
{c-omd} cmk -vI --detect-plugins=flintstone_setup_check mydevice01
Discovering services and host labels on: mydevice01
mydevice01:
+ FETCHING DATA
No piggyback files for 'mydevice01'. Skip processing.
No piggyback files for '127.0.0.1'. Skip processing.
Get piggybacked data
+ ANALYSE DISCOVERED HOST LABELS
SUCCESS - Found no new host labels
+ ANALYSE DISCOVERED SERVICES
+ EXECUTING DISCOVERY PLUGINS (1)
  1 flintstone_setup_check
SUCCESS - Found 1 services
----

As expected, the service discovery was successful.
Now you can test the check contained in the check plug-in:

[{shell},highlight=6]
----
{c-omd} cmk -v --detect-plugins=flintstone_setup_check mydevice01
+ FETCHING DATA
No piggyback files for 'mydevice01'. Skip processing.
No piggyback files for '127.0.0.1'. Skip processing.
Get piggybacked data
Flintstone setup check All required information is available.
No piggyback files for 'mydevice01'. Skip processing.
No piggyback files for '127.0.0.1'. Skip processing.
[snmp] Success, [piggyback] Success ...
----

After restarting the monitoring core &#8230;

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -R
Generating configuration for core (type nagios)...
Precompiling host checks...OK
Validating Nagios configuration...OK
Restarting monitoring core...OK
----

&#8230; the new service will then be visible in the monitoring:

.Since all fields of the three SNMP leaves are filled, the service is {OK}

[#errors]
== Troubleshooting

As the troubleshooting in xref:devel_check_plugins#errors[agent-based check plug-ins] essentially also applies to SNMP-based check plug-ins, we will only deal with the SNMP specifics here.


[#simulation]
=== Simulation options

[#savedwalk]
==== Using saved SNMP walks in {CMK}

In the article on monitoring via SNMP xref:snmp#simulation[we show in detail] how you can create SNMP walks from the GUI and how you can use them for simulation.
This also makes it possible to develop check plug-ins on test systems that cannot access the SNMP hosts for which you are developing a plug-in.
In our GitHub repository you will find an example of an link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk-docs/blob/master/examples/devel_check_plugins_snmp/flintstones_fred_router.txt[SNMP walk^], which we use in this article and which you can use to develop and test the check plug-in.


[#dummydaemon]
==== The dummy SNMP daemon

If you want to ensure that specific OIDs change depending on each other, it can be useful to program a dummy SNMP daemon that delivers consistent data.
The link:https://pypi.org/project/snmp-agent/[Python `snmp-agent` module^] can be an aid when programming such a dummy.


[#hwbugs]
=== Uncooperative hardware

Before a device can be monitored with a new SNMP-based check plug-in, it must first be able to be monitored via SNMP.
You can therefore find an overview of known problems with suggested solutions in the article on xref:snmp#cursedhardware[Monitoring via SNMP].
