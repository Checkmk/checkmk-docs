[#intro]
== Synthetic monitoring with Robot Framework

{cee-only} {CMK} Synthetic Monitoring is available in the commercial {CMK} editions, but it requires an link:https://checkmk.com/request-quote/synthetic-monitoring[additional subscription^].
You can however test the function with up to three tests free of charge and without a time limit.

With {CMK} you can monitor your own infrastructure very closely -- right down to the question of whether a particular service, such as a web server, is running properly.
If your website is operated via a third-party cloud service, you will not have access to the service itself, but you can use an HTTP check to verify whether the website is accessible.
But will that say anything about the user experience? The fact that an online store is accessible does not mean that navigation, ordering processes and the like work smoothly.

This is where {CMK} Synthetic Monitoring comes in.
With the Robotmk plug-in, {CMK} offers genuine end-to-end monitoring, i.e. the monitoring of running applications from the user's perspective.
The actual testing is carried out by the open-source software link:https://robotframework.org/[Robot Framework^] -- of which {comfull} is also a member.

The automation software can be used to fully replicate a user's behavior, for example to simulate order processes in online stores, 'click-by-click'.
The special thing about Robot Framework is that tests are not written in a fully-fledged programming language, but are defined using easy-to-use keywords such as `Open Browser` or `Click Button`.
An `Open Browser checkmk.com` is sufficient to call up the {CMK} website.
Several test cases are then combined in so-called test suites (in the form of a `.robot` file).

Robotmk can now trigger these Robot Framework test suites on the host and monitor their execution and results as services in {CMK}.
In the {CMK} web interface you will then find the status, associated performance graphs and the original evaluations of Robot Framework itself.


=== Components

Multiple components work together to create this end-to-end monitoring, so here is a brief overview.


==== {CMK} server

{CMK} Synthetic monitoring is realized via Robotmk, which uses an agent plug-in as a data collector, and the Robotmk scheduler (on the monitored host) for triggering Robot Framework projects.
Synthetic monitoring is activated and configured via the [.guihint]#Robotmk Scheduler# rule.
Here you specify which test suites should be executed and how exactly Robot Framework should start them -- summarized in a _plan._
Once rolled out, the Robotmk scheduler on the target host ensures the scheduled execution of your Robot Framework suites.

In the monitoring, a number of new services will be generated: [.guihint]#RMK Scheduler Status# shows the status of the scheduler itself, i.e. whether test suites could be started successfully.
There are also services for all configured test plans (such as [.guihint]#RMK MyApp1 Plan#) and individual tests from test suites (such as [.guihint]#RMK MyApp1 Test#).
The services of the individual tests also include the original Robot Framework reports.

Last but not least, there are two optional service rules: [.guihint]#Robotmk plan# and [.guihint]#Robotmk test# provide for fine-tuning the plan and test services -- for example, to effect status changes at certain runtimes.

.The Robotmk rules in {CMK}
image::robotmk_services_menu.png[alt="Robotmk rules in the setup menu."]


==== Test machine

You must provide the Robot Framework test suites on a *Windows host*.
For execution, Robot Framework requires access to their dependencies (Python, libraries, drivers for browser automation and so on).
This configuration is independent of {CMK} and can be stored declaratively in a portable package.
This is performed with the open-source command line tool link:https://github.com/robocorp/rcc[RCC^].
This tool uses your configuration files in YAML format to build virtual Python environments including dependencies and the Robot Framework itself.
The Robotmk scheduler running as a background process triggers this build and then executes the tests itself.

Such an _RCC automation package_ with the package configuration (`robot.yaml`), the definition of the execution environment (`conda.yaml`) and the test suites (`tests.robot`) is also called _robot_.
RCC and the scheduler are rolled out with the {CMK} agent, the automation package must be available on the host.

The great advantage of RCC is that the executing Windows host itself does not require a configured Python environment.

The agent itself is only required for the transfer of results, logs and screenshots.
This also enables the monitoring of very long-running or locally very resource-intensive suites -- provided that your Windows host has the corresponding capacities.


[#ruleconfig]
== Monitoring test suites with Robotmk

In the following, we will show you how to include a test suite in the monitoring.
As an example we will use a simple Hello World suite which only outputs two strings and which waits briefly between each.
An introduction to Robot Framework is of course not the subject of this article, but a brief look at the automation package and the demo test suite is necessary so that you can see which data ends up where in the monitoring.

The example runs on the basis of RCC, so that the Windows host does not have to be configured separately.
The `rcc.exe` is rolled out with the agent and can be found under `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\bin\`.
You can download the sample suite as a ZIP file link:https://github.com/elabit/robotmk-examples/blob/main/minimal.zip[via GitHub^].
The directory of the suite:

.C:\robots\mybot\
[{file}]
----
conda.yaml
robot.yaml
tests.robot
----

[TIP]
====
RCC can also process test suites based on a number of other programming languages, but for use in {CMK} it must be the Robot Framework declaration.
====

The suite directory now contains two important files:
The declaration of the environment required for execution in the file `conda.yaml` and the actual tests in the file `tests.robot` (the suite).
The `robot.yaml` file is not relevant for use in {CMK}, but is required by RCC.

For the sake of completeness, here is a brief look into `robot.yaml` file:

.C:\robots\mybot\robot.yaml
[{file}]
----
tasks:
  task1:
    # (task definitions are not required by Robotmk,
    but expected by RCC to be compatible with other Robocorp features)
    shell: echo "nothing to do"

environmentConfigs:
  - conda.yaml

artifactsDir: output 
----

At first, `tasks` defines which tasks, here tests, are to be executed at all.
However, although this part is formally required by RCC, it is not used by Robotmk.

[TIP]
====
Robot Framework distinguishes between tests and tasks, which stand for automations.
However, both are used in exactly the same way.
====

In the `environmentConfigs` area, only the `conda.yaml` is referenced, which takes care about the actual environment.

In this case, only the Python, Pip and Robot Framework dependencies are installed for the environment.
The environment build later appears in the monitoring as [.guihint]#RCC environment build status#.
The tests can only be processed and consequently monitored if the environment has been built successfully.

.c:\robots\mybot\conda.yaml
[{file}]
----
channels:
  - conda-forge

dependencies:
  - python=3.10.12
  - pip=23.2.1
  - pip:
     - robotframework==7.0
----

The actual test suite now looks like this:

.C:\robots\mybot\tests.robot
[{file}]
----
*** Settings ***
Documentation Template robot main suite.

*** Variables ***
${MYVAR}    Hello Checkmk!

*** Test Cases ***
My Test
    Log ${MYVAR}
    Sleep 3
    Log Done.

----

Here, only the value of the `MYVAR` variable is output, then following a 3 second wait, `Done` will be output.
You can set the value of the variable later in the {CMK} web interface -- otherwise the default `Hello Checkmk!` specified here will be used.

[TIP]
====
You can run this test suite manually.
To do this, the agent and RCC must already be installed (or you can download the RCC binary yourself).
First navigate to your test suite directory, where the `tests.robot` is also located.
Then start the RCC shell with `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\bin\rcc.exe task shell`.
The virtual environment defined in `conda.yaml` is then created.
Then start the suite with `robot tests.robot`.
====

And this is exactly what the Robotmk scheduler does as soon as the agent plug-in has been activated.


[#agentconfig]
=== Configure a rule for the agent plug-in

You can find the Robotmk scheduler under [.guihint]#Setup > Agent rules > Robotmk scheduler (Windows)#.
As the rule is quite extensive, here is a look at the empty configuration:

.Configuration of the agent plug-in
image::robotmk_scheduler_00.png[alt="Empty Robotmk scheduler rule."]

First, the scheduler requires the base directory in which all your test suites are located.
Enter this arbitrary, explicit file path under [.guihint]#Base directory of suites#, for example `C:\robots`.

.Base directory for all Robot Framework projects
image::robotmk_scheduler_01.png[alt="Path for test suites."]

The [.guihint]#Parallel plan groups# that are shown now are a {CMK}-specific concept.

To explain this, we must first go down one hierarchy level: Here you can see the item [.guihint]#Sequential plans#.
Such a sequential plan defines which suites are to be executed with which parameters.
Robot Framework will process these suites one after the other.
The reason for this is simple: in practice, tests are sometimes run on the desktop and several test suites could get in each other's way at the same time (think of them stealing each others control of the mouse cursor).

The plan groups are now an encapsulation for sequentially executed plans -- and are themselves executed in parallel.
Again, the reasoning is simple: this allows test suites that do not rely on the desktop to be executed in their own plans without delay -- the test suite used in this article is a good example of such processing.

Back to the dialog: The only explicit setting is the execution interval, which you set under [.guihint]#Group execution interval#.

.Interval for the (parallel) execution of plan groups
image::robotmk_scheduler_02.png[alt='Execution interval for execution groups.']

[IMPORTANT]
====
The plans in the plan group naturally have their own runtimes, determined by the timeout of a single execution and the maximum number of repeated executions in the event of failed tests. 
The execution interval of the plan group must therefore be greater than the sum of the maximum runtimes of all plans in the group.
The maximum runtime of a plan is calculated as follows: [.guihint]#Limit per attempt# × (1 + [.guihint]#Maximum number of re-executions#).
====

Now it's time to configure the first plan.
You can enter any name under [.guihint]#Application name#.
This name does not have to be unique!
The name of the application to be monitored makes sense here, for example `OnlineShop`, or here in this example simply `MyApplication`.
Of course, it can happen that this online store is tested several times, either by other test suites or by the same test suite with different parameters.
In such cases, the [.guihint]#Variant# field is used to achieve unambiguous results despite identical names.
For example, if the application `OnlineShop` is tested once in German and once in English (via corresponding parameters), you could use corresponding abbreviations here.
The monitoring will then return results for `My OnlineShop_en` and `My OnlineShop_de`.

However, the specification under [.guihint]#Relative path to test suite file or folder# is necessary.
The path is relative to the base directory specified above, e.g. `mybot\test.robot` for `C:\robots\`.
Alternatively, a directory (with several `robot` files) can also be specified here, in which case it would simply be `mybot`. 

.Plan for the execution of suites 
image::robotmk_scheduler_03.png[alt="Name and path of the suite."]

Continue with the [.guihint]#Execution configuration.#
Under [.guihint]#Limit per attempt# you define the maximum elapsed time -- per attempt -- that a test suite may run.
With [.guihint]#Robot Framework re-executions# you can now instruct Robot Framework to repeat test suites completely or incrementally if tests fail.
If the individual tests in a test suite are independent of each other, the incremental strategy is the best way to save time.
If, on the other hand, the test suite tests a logical sequence, such as "Login -> Call up product page -> Product in shopping cart -> Checkout", the test suite must of course be completely reprocessed.
In the end, there is always only one result.

In the case of complete retries, only the results from self-contained suites are taken into account for the final result: If a test fails on its final retry, the test suite is counted as a failure.
In the case of incremental retries, the final result is made up of the best partial results: If some tests only run successfully on the third attempt, the final result is also counted as a success.
Reminder: The combination of attempts and maximum run times of all plans in a plan group determines their minimum execution interval.

.Failed tests/suites can be repeated
image::robotmk_scheduler_04.png[alt="Configuration of execution runtimes and repetitions."]

By default, execution via RCC is activated under [.guihint]#Automated environment setup (via RCC)#, for which you must enter two values.
Firstly, RCC requires the specification of where the `robot.yaml` file is located.
Its primary purpose is to reference the `conda.yaml` file, which is responsible for setting up the Python environment, i.e. installing Python and dependencies.
This specification is relative to the base directory that you have set above under [.guihint]#Relative path to test suite file or folder#.
The YAML files can be saved in subdirectories, but best practice is the top suite directory.
For the above base directory `C:\robot\` and the suite directory `C:\robot\mybot` it is accordingly `mybot\robot.yaml`.

With the following time limit for building the Python environment, you should bear in mind that sometimes large volumes of data need to be downloaded and set up.
Especially for the required browsers, several hundred megabytes are quickly accumulated -- but only for the first run.
RCC only rebuilds environments if the content of `conda.yaml` has changed.

.Time limit for building virtual environments
image::robotmk_scheduler_05.png[alt="RCC configuration of the suite."]

Under [.guihint]#Robot Framework parameters# you have the possibility to use some of the command line parameters of Robot Framework (which are also displayed by the command `robot --help`).
If you want to use additional parameters, the option [.guihint]#Argument files# will help.
A file specified here can contain any robot parameters.
Further information about the individual parameters can be found in the inline help.

For our example project, only the option [.guihint]#Variables# is activated and a variable `MYVAR` with the value `My Value` is set.
Remember the command `Log ${MYVAR}` at the top of the file `tests.robot`?
This is the corresponding reference.

.Some options of the `robot` command
image::robotmk_scheduler_06.png[alt="Command line parameters of Robot Framework."]

At the end of the suite configuration, there are three largely self-explanatory options.
[.guihint]#Execute plan as a specific user# allows Robotmk to be executed in the context of a specific user account.
Background: By default, Robotmk is executed in the context of the {CMK} agent (link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account[LocalSystem account^]), which has no authorization to access the desktop.
Here a user can be specified who must be permanently logged in to a desktop session and who has access to graphical desktop applications accordingly.

With [.guihint]#Assign plan/test result to piggyback host# the results of the plan/test can be assigned to another host.
For example, if Robot Framework is testing the ordering process of an online store, the results can be assigned to the corresponding web server.

Each test run produces data that is stored under `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\robotmk_output\working\suites\`.
By default, results from the last 14 days are retained, but you should bear in mind that large volumes of data can quickly accumulate here.
At least 500 kilobytes of data are generated per run -- with more complex test suites and embedded screenshots, for example, this can quickly add up to several megabytes of data.
Depending on the execution interval, the size of the report and your documentation requirements, you should intervene in such a situation.

.Automatic cleanup of the large volume of generated data
image::robotmk_scheduler_07.png[alt="Options for user context, host assignment and automatic cleanup"]

Once here, you can now create further plans in this plan group or further plan groups.

At the end there are two more options, which in turn relate to the complete Robotmk scheduler configuration.

[.guihint]#RCC profile configuration# allows you to specify proxy servers and hosts to be excluded.

[.guihint]#Grace period before scheduler starts# can also be very useful: The scheduler starts together with the {CMK} agent before the desktop logon -- which, of course, means that any tests on the desktop must fail.
The start can be manually delayed using a grace period.

.A grace period prevents failures
image::robotmk_scheduler_08.png[alt="Options for proxy server and a grace period for the scheduler start."]

This completes the configuration and you can bake a new xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[agent with the plug-in] and then roll it out, manually or via the xref:agent_deployment#[automatic agent updates].

==== Data in the agent output

The output in the agent is quite extensive:
error messages, status, configuration and test data are transmitted in several sections.
The latter can be found in the `robotmk_suite_execution_report` section, here is an abbreviated excerpt:

.mysite-robot-host-agent.txt
[{json}]
----
<<<robotmk_suite_execution_report:sep(0)>>>
{
    "attempts": [
        {
            "index": 1,
            "outcome": "AllTestsPassed",

        }
    ],

        }
    },
    "suite_id": "mybot",
    "timestamp": 1710861778
}
...
"html_base64":"PCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw+DQo8aHRtbCBsYW ...
----

Two areas are of particular interest here.
Firstly, `rebot`: The `rebot` tool has produced the actual status report for Robot Framework from several partial results (hence re-bot).
Secondly, the last line `html_base64`: The HTML reports from Robot Framework are then base64-encoded.
Screenshots taken via tests are also transferred in this way -- the output/data volume in the agent can be correspondingly extensive.


==== Data in monitoring

As soon as the Robotmk scheduler and the test suite have been run, the xref:glossar#service_discovery[service discovery] will produce three new services: 

.The newly discovered Robotmk services
image::robotmk_scheduler_09.png[alt="Robotmk-Services im Monitoring"]

The service [.guihint]#RMK Scheduler Status# exists once and immediately after deployment.
The services for plans and tests, here [.guihint]#RMK MyApplication_mybot Plan# and [.guihint]#RMK MyApplication_mybot Test: /Test: My Test#, are added to the monitoring as soon as the associated suites have been run for the first time.


[#serviceconfig]
=== Configuring service rules

==== Creating a rule for the plan status

Reminder: Maximum runtimes for plans were defined in the agent rule above.
These runtimes can be evaluated with the [.guihint]#Robotmk plan# rule.
For example, you can set the service to {CRIT} when 90 percent of all calculated timeouts have been reached.

.Threshold values for status changes based on runtimes
image::robotmk_service_suite_status_01.png[alt="Configuration dialog for threshold values for runtimes of test suites."]

In the [.guihint]#Conditions# box, there is the option of restricting the rule to specific plans.

.Optional restriction to certain plans
image::robotmk_service_suite_status_02.png[alt="Dialog with restriction to the test suite 'mybot'."]


==== Creating a rule for the test status

Additional data can also be retrieved for individual tests in the test suites via the [.guihint]#Robotmk test# rule.
Here you will again find the option to monitor runtimes, both for tests and keywords.
The monitoring of keywords is a {CMK}-specific function.
Therefore, the suite-internal status in the Robot Framework report could also be `OK` because the test suite was processed within the maximum permitted runtime -- in {CMK}, however, {WARN} or {CRIT}, because a status change takes place at, for example, 80 percent of this maximum permitted runtime.

In addition, the [.guihint]#Enable metrics for high-level keywords# option can be used to generate metrics for higher-level keywords.
This is particularly useful if your tests are organized in such a way that the higher-level keywords describe the 'what' and the lower-level keywords describe the 'how' -- this gives you more abstract evaluations.

In this example, the threshold values for the maximum runtime of a test are 2 and 4 seconds.
You will see the effects below in the chapter xref:#monitoring[Robotmk in monitoring].

.Monitoring can be expanded using keyword metrics
image::robotmk_service_test_status_01.png[alt="Rule for monitoring keywords with example values."]

Once again, there is an explicit filter option in the [.guihint]#Conditions# box, here for individual tests.

.Optional restriction to certain tests
image::robotmk_service_test_status_02.png[alt="Dialog with option to restrict to tests."]


[#monitoring]
=== Robotmk in monitoring

In monitoring, you will find services for the status of the Robotmk scheduler as well as the individual plans and tests -- even if you have not created any separate service rules.


==== Scheduler status

The service [.guihint]#RMK Scheduler Status# is {OK} if the scheduler is running and has successfully built the execution environments.

.RCC was able to build the environments -- in just one second
image::robotmk_monitorng_scheduler.png[alt="Status of the scheduler in monitoring."]

Here in the image you can see the note [.guihint]#Environment build took 1 second.#
One second to build a virtual Python environment with Pip and Robot Framework?
This is possible because RCC is clever: files that have already been downloaded are reused and a new build is only carried out after changes have been made in `conda.yaml`.
The first build would have taken 30 seconds or more.


==== Plan status

The status of a plan is reflected in a service named by application name and suite, for example [.guihint]#RMK MyApplication_mybot Plan#.

.The execution of a plan -- especially relevant for administrators
image::robotmk_monitorng_suite.png[alt="Status of the test suite in monitoring."]


==== Test status

The evaluation of the tests is where it gets really interesting.
In the image you can now see the effect of the threshold values set above for the runtime of tests -- here the 2 seconds for the {WARN} status.
As the `Sleep 3 Seconds` instruction in the test itself already ensures a longer runtime, this service must go to {WARN} here, although the test was successful.
The fact that the test was successful is shown by the Robot Framework report, which you can access via the icon:icon_log[Alt="Log-Icon."] log icon.

.Results of a specific suite -- especially relevant for developers
image::robotmk_monitorng_test.png[alt="Status of the test in monitoring."]

The report now clearly shows that the test and test suite have run successfully.

.The Robot Framework log, here in optional dark mode
image::robotmk_monitorng_report_01.png[alt="Robot Framework report for 'Mybot' test suite."]

At the bottom of the data you can also see the individual keywords, here for example `Log ${MYVAR}` together with the value `My value` set in {CMK} for `MYVAR`.

.The log file can be expanded down to the smallest details
image::robotmk_monitorng_report_02.png[alt="Robot Framework report at keyword level."]


==== Dashboards

Of course, you can build your own dashboards as usual -- but you can also find two built-in dashboards under [.guihint]#Monitor > Synthetic Monitoring#.

image::robotmk_dashboard_01.png[alt="Robotmk dashboard in the web interface."]


[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

=== Scheduler reports `No Data`

If the scheduler does not receive any data, building the environment probably did not work.
A common reason for this are network problems, for example, due to which certain dependencies cannot be loaded.
In this case, take a look at the corresponding log file under `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\robotmk_output\working\environment_building`.


=== Environment building fails: `post-install script execution`

This is a particularly interesting error that you might encounter on fresh Windows systems.
The `conda.yaml` can also contain instructions that are to be executed after the installation of the dependencies -- for example, the initialization of the Robot Framework browser.
Python commands should therefore be executed here.
By default, Windows 11 has aliases for `python.exe` and `python3.exe` that refer to the Microsoft Store.
You must deactivate these aliases under 'Settings/Aliases for app execution'.
