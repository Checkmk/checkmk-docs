== Introduction

This document lists the platforms and integrations supported by {CMK} {v22}.
Except for very specific reasons (e.g. security), these platforms, including all patch versions will remain supported through active maintenance during the {CMK} {v22} product lifecycle.


[#os]
== Server OS

{CMK} can be installed on the following Linux server OS distributions and versions running on x86_64 hardware.
Entries might contain the following additions:

* _Deprecated:_ LTS/LTSS versions marked in this way are still supported for the entire life cycle of version {v22}. Support will be ceased afterwards. For Ubuntu STS versions, supplying {CMK} {v22} packages ends xref:update_matrix#ossupport[shortly after Ubuntu stops supporting] them with updates.
* _Once released:_ Support for these versions is planned. {CMK} {v22} packages will be made available shortly after the release of the new distribution version.

We will additionally evaluate any new versions of these distributions as a part of our ongoing support process.
These will be covered in the xref:update_matrix#[update matrix].

*Important*: Starting with {CMK} {v23} Ubuntu STS versions will not be supported anymore.
