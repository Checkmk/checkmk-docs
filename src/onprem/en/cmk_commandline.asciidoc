== Why command line?

When a {CMK}-System has been installed, it can be 100{nbsp}% configured and
operated using the web interface. There are nonetheless situations in
which it is useful to dive into the depths of the command line,
for example:

* when searching for the source of problems
* when automating the administration of {CMK}
* when programming and testing your own extensions
* to be able to understand how {CMK} functions internally
* if you simply enjoy working with the command line!


This article will present the most important commands, files and directories
on {CMK}'s command line.


[#site_user]
== The site user


=== Login as site user

When administering {CMK}, with a few exceptions you need never work
as the `root`-user. In this article we will generally assume that
you are logged in as a _site user_. That is done with, e.g.:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} su - mysite
----

It is also possible to make a direct SSH-login to a site without a detour
via `root`. Since the site user is a ‘completely normal’ Linux user,
you must simply assign a password for this (which
requires `root`-permissions, once only, for the configuration):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} passwd mysite
Enter new UNIX password: *pass:[**********]*
Retype new UNIX password: *pass:[**********]*
passwd: password updated successfully
----

Afterwards an SSH-login directly from another computer should be possible
(Windows-users preferably use PuTTY for this). From Linux this login is simply
performed in the command line using the `ssh` command:

[{shell}]
----
user@otherhost> ssh mysite@myserver123
mysite@localhost's password: *pass:[**********]*
----

At the first login a ‘warning’ regarding an unknown host key will probably
be received. When you are certain that in this brief moment no attacker has
taken over your operating system's IP-address, you can simply verify it
with `yes`.

You can also work with the command line on the {CMK}-appliance.
How that is done is explained in its xref:appliance_usage#ssh[own article].


=== Profile and environment variables

So that as few problems as possible arise, particularly as a result of individual
distributions or differing operating system configurations, the {CMK}-system
ensures that the site user – and likewise all of the monitoring's processes
 – always have a clearly defined environment. Along with the home directory
and the permissions, the *environment variables* play an important role.

Among other things, when logging in as a site user the following variables
will be set or modified. These variables are available for use in all processes
running within the site. This also applies to scripts that are indirectly
invoked by these processes (for example, a user's own xref:notifications#scripts[notification scripts]).

[cols="25,~"]
|===
|`OMD_SITE` |The site's name (`mysite`). In custom scripts this variable should always be used rather than a hard coded site name (e.g. with `$OMD_SITE` in the shell). With this the script can also be used unchanged in other sites.
|`OMD_ROOT` |The path for the site directory (`/omd/sites/mysite`)
|`PATH` |Directories in which executable programs will be searched for. For example, {CMK} keeps the site's `bin/` here. In the case of identical names, {CMK} programs have priority – this is important, e.g., for the `mail` command, a special version of which is provided with a {CMK} installation.
|`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` |Directories in which additional binary libraries are searched for. Using this variable {CMK} ensures that libraries provided with {CMK} have priority over those installed in the normal operating system.
|`PERL5LIB` |Search path for the Perl module. Here, too, module variants delivered by {CMK} have priority in case of doubt.
|`LANG` |The language setting for command line commands. This setting is adopted from the Linux installation. This variable is automatically deleted in the site's processes, and the setting reverts to the default English! This also affects other regional settings.  Removing `LANG` is very important, since a number of standard Nagios plug-ins, for example, the German language setting, uses a comma for the decimal separator instead of a point. Your output can thus not be accurately processed.
|===

With the `env` command you can output all of the environment variables
 – adding `| sort` to this command arranges the list a bit more clearly:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} env | sort
HOME=/omd/sites/mysite
LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib:/omd/sites/mysite/lib
LOGNAME=mysite
MAILRC=/omd/sites/mysite/etc/mail.rc
MAIL=/var/mail/mysite
MANPATH=/omd/sites/mysite/share/man:
MODULEBUILDRC=/omd/sites/mysite/.modulebuildrc
MP_STATE_DIRECTORY=/omd/sites/mysite/var/monitoring-plugins
NAGIOS_PLUGIN_STATE_DIRECTORY=/omd/sites/mysite/var/monitoring-plugins
OMD_ROOT=/omd/sites/mysite
OMD_SITE=mysite
PATH=/omd/sites/mysite/lib/perl5/bin:/omd/sites/mysite/local/bin:/omd/sites/mysite/bin:/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/perl5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
PERL5LIB=/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/perl5/lib/perl5:/omd/sites/mysite/lib/perl5/lib/perl5:
PERL_MM_OPT=INSTALL_BASE=/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/perl5/
PWD=/omd/sites/mysite
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/omd/sites/mysite/var/ssl/ca-certificates.crt
SHELL=/bin/bash
SHLVL=1
TERM=xterm
USER=mysite
_=/usr/bin/env
----

Under Linux the environment is an attribute of a _process_. Every process
has its own variables, which it automatically passes on to sub-processes.
These start initially with the same, inherited variables, but can also alter them.

With the `env` command you can always only view the current shell's
environment. If you suspect there is an error in a particular process's
environment, with a small trick you can nonetheless output a listing of its environment.
For this you only need the process-ID (PID).
You can identify this with, e.g., `ps ax`, `pstree -p` or `top`.
With this you can then access the process's `environ` file directly via
the `/proc` file system. Here as an example
is a suitable command for the PID `13222`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} tr \\0 \\n < /proc/13222/environ | sort
----

If you require custom variables for your own scripts or other software to be run
in the site, store them in the `etc/environment` file which has been
specially created for this purpose. All variables defined here will
be available everywhere within the site:

.etc/environment
[{file}]
----
# Custom environment variables
#
# Here you can set environment variables. These will
# be set in interactive mode when logging in as site
# user and also when starting the OMD processes with
# omd start.
#
# This file has shell syntax, but without 'export'.
# Better use quotes if your values contain spaces.
#
# Example:
#
# FOO="bar"
# FOO2="With some spaces"
#
MY_SUPER_VAR=blabla123
MY_OTHER_VAR=10.88.112.17
----


=== Customizing the shell

If you wish to customize your shell (Prompt or other things), you can perform this as
usual in the `.bashrc` file. Environment variables nonetheless belong to
`etc/environment`, so that they are certain to be available to all processes.

There is also nothing to prevent you having your own `.vimrc` file
if you like working with VIM.


[#folder_structure]
== The directory structure


=== The separation of software and data

The following graphic shows the most important directories in a {CMK} installation with a site named `mysite` and a `<version>` called for example `2.0.0p8.cee`:

image::filesystem.png[alt="Illustration of the directory structure of a {CMK} site."]

The basis for this structure is provided by the `/omd` directory.
Without exception, all of the files for {CMK} are found here.
`/omd` is in fact a symbolic link to `/opt/omd`, while the actual _physical_
data is located in `/opt` – but all data paths in {CMK} always use `/omd`.

Important is the separation of data (highlighted yellow) and software (blue).
The site's data is found in `/omd/sites`, and the installed software
in `/omd/versions`.


[#sitedir]
=== Site directory

Like every Linux user, the site user also has a home directory,
which we refer to as the site directory. If your site is named
`mysite` it will be found in `/omd/sites/mysite`.
As usual in Linux the shell abbreviates the its own home directory with a
tilde (`~`) (or swung dash). Since immediately following a login you will
actually be in this directory, the tilde appears automatically in the input prompt:

[{shell}]
----
OMD[mysite]#:~$#
----

Subdirectories of the site directory are shown relative to the tilde:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cd var/log
OMD[mysite]#:~/var/log$#
----

A number of subdirectories are located within the site directory,
these can be listed with `ll`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll
total 16
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   11 Jan 24 11:56 bin -> version/bin/
drwxr-xr-x 19 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 11:56 etc/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   15 Jan 24 11:56 include -> version/include/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   11 Jan 24 11:56 lib -> version/lib/
drwxr-xr-x  5 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 11:56 local/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   13 Jan 24 11:56 share -> version/share/
drwxr-xr-x  2 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 09:57 tmp/
drwxr-xr-x 12 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 11:56 var/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   29 Jan 24 11:56 version -> ../../versions/2.0.0p8.cee/
----

As can be seen, the directories `bin`, `include`, `lib`,
`share` and `version` are symbolic links.
The rest are ‘normal’ directories. This mirrors the separation of software and
and data as explained above. The software directory must be accessible as a
subdirectory in the site, but it is physically located in `/omd/versions`,
and can also possibly be used by other sites.

[cols="25,35,~",options="header"]
|===
| |Software |Data
|Directories |`bin`, `include`, `lib`, `share` |`etc`, `local`, `tmp`, `var`
|Owner |`root` |Site user (`mysite`)
|Created by |{CMK} installation |Site creation, configuration, and monitoring
|Physical location |`/omd/versions/2.0.0p8.cee/` |`/omd/sites/mysite/`
|File type |Symbolic links |Normal directories
|===


=== Software

The software directories, as usual under Linux, belong to `root`
and thus may not be altered by a site user. The following subdirectories
are present – those in the example are physically located within the
`/omd/versions/2.0.0p8.cee`, and they are accessible via symbolic links
from the site directory:

[cols="20,~"]
|===
|`bin/` |Directory for executable programs. Here the `cmk` command is found, for example.
|`lib/` |C-directories, plug-ins for Apache and Python – and in the `nagios/plugins` subdirectory – standard monitoring plug-ins, which are mostly written in C or Perl.
|`share/` |The main part of the installed software. Very many components are located in `share/check_mk` – among others, well over 2,000 check plug-ins.
|`include/` |Contains Include-files for C-programs, which should be linked to libraries in `lib/`. This directory is not important and is only used if you wish to translate C-programs yourself.
|===

The `version/` symbolic link is a ‘intermediate stop’ and serves as a relay
point for the version used by the site. During a xref:update#[software update] this
will be switched from the old to the new version. Nonetheless, please do not attempt
to perform an update manually by altering the link, since an update
requires a number of other further steps – which will fail.


[#data]
=== Data

The actual *data* for a site is found in the remaining subdirectories
in the site directory. Without exception, these belong to the site user.
The site directory itself is also included. {CMK} stores nothing apart from
the directories listed there. You can create your own files and directories
without problem here, in which tests, downloaded data, copies of log files, etc.
can be kept as desired.

The following directories have been predefined:

[cols="15,~"]
|===
|`etc/` |Configuration files. These can be edited either by hand or by using {CMK}'s xref:wato#[Setup].

Note: The scripts in `etc/init.d` are actually also ‘configuration’ files, since they are found in `etc/`. This is based on the same pattern as found in every Linux system under `/etc/init.d/`. We do advise against changing this script however, since this can lead to xref:update#conflicts[conflicts] during a software update. Changes to the scripts are not necessary.

|`var/` |Runtime data. All data generated by the monitoring will be stored here. Depending on the number of hosts and services, an immense volume of data can be accumulated – of which the largest part is the performance data recorded in the xref:graphing#rrds[RRDs].

|`tmp/` |Volatile data. {CMK} and other components store temporary data (which does not need to be retained) here. A `tmpfs` is therefore mounted here. This is a file system which manages data in RAM, thus generating zero Disk-IO. Restarting the computer results in the loss of all data in `tmp/`! Stopping and starting the site does _not_ delete the data.  Data such as sockets, pipes and PID-files can be found in `tmp/run` – these are necessary for communication and managing the server processes.  Do *not* use `tmp/` for storing your own data, since this directory is mounted to the RAM where space is rather limited. Store your own data directly in the site directory, or in your own subdirectory within it.

|`local/` |Own extensions. A ‘shadow’ hierarchy of the software directories `bin/`, `lib/` and `share/` can be found in `local/`. These are intended for your own changes or extensions to the software.  Also applicable here: Under no circumstances store test files, log files, security copies or anything else that does not belong there, in `local/`. {CMK} could attempt to execute these files as a part of the software. Likewise, in a distributed monitoring the data will also be duplicated to all remote sites.
|===


[#local]
=== Modifying and extending {CMK} – the local files

As just shown in the above table, the `local` directory with its numerous
subdirectories is intended for your own extensions.
In a new site, all of the directories in `local/` are initially empty.

With the practical `tree` command you can quickly get an overview of the
structure of `local`.
The `-L 3` option restricts the depth to 3:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} tree -L 3 local
local
├── bin
├── lib
│   ├── apache
│   ├── check_mk -> python3/cmk
│   ├── nagios
│   │   └── plugins
│   ├── python
│   └── python3
│       └── cmk
└── share
    ├── check_mk
    │   ├── agents
    │   ├── alert_handlers
    │   ├── checkman
    │   ├── checks
    │   ├── inventory
    │   ├── locale
    │   ├── mibs
    │   ├── notifications
    │   ├── pnp-rraconf
    │   ├── pnp-templates
    │   ├── reporting
    │   └── web
    ├── diskspace
    ├── doc
    │   └── check_mk
    ├── nagios
    │   └── htdocs
    ├── nagvis
    │   └── htdocs
    └── snmp
        └── mibs
----

All of the directories in the _lowest_ level are actively integrated in the software.
A file stored here will be treated in the same way as if it was in the directory with the
same name within `/omd/versions/...` (or respectively, in the logical path from the
site under `bin`, `lib` or `share`).

Example: In the site, executable programs will be searched for in `bin`
and in `local/bin`.

Here it applies that in the case of _identical names_ the file in `local`
always has priority. This enables modification of the software without the need
to change installation files in  `/omd/versions/`. The procedure is simple:

. Copy the desired file to the appropriate directory in `local`.
. Modify this file.
. Restart the appropriate service so that the change can take effect.

Regarding point 3 above, if it is not known exactly which service to which the
change applies, simply restart the complete site with `omd restart`.


[#logs]
=== Log files

In {CMK} – as already-described – the log files are stored in the
xref:data[directory] `var/`.
All log files of the relevant components can be found there:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll -R var/log/

On the web interface you can easily configure the extent to which data should be written to the log files by searching in [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings# for all entries with `logging`:

image::cmk_commandline_global_settings_logging.png[alt="List of global settings for logging."]

Alternatively it is possible to also customize the log levels on the command line in configuration files.
The files are each called `global.mk`, but are located in different directories.
Specify the entries if they are not already present, which is the case, if a [.guihint]#Factory setting# has not yet been changed.

.~/etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/global.mk
[{file}]
----
notification_logging = 15
alert_logging = 10
cmc_log_levels = {

 'cmk.smartping'    : 5,
}
cmc_log_rrdcreation = None
----

In this file the [.guihint]#Monitoring Core#, [.guihint]#Notifications# and [.guihint]#Alert Handlers# entries are set:

* For `notification_logging` you can choose between the values 10 for [.guihint]#Full dump of all variables and command#,
15 for [.guihint]#Normal logging# and 20 for [.guihint]#Minimal logging#.

* The `alert_logging` can be set to 10 for [.guihint]#Full dump of all variables# or 20 for [.guihint]#Normal logging#.

* For `cmc_log_levels` the amount of logged data increases by increasing the number.
Here there are eight gradations (0 to 7) ranging from 0 for [.guihint]#Emergency# to 7 which stands for [.guihint]#Debug#.

* With the three values `None`, `'terse'` and `'full'` for `cmc_log_rrdcreation` you can decide whether the creation of xref:graphing#rrds[RRDs]  should be logged and how.

.~/etc/check_mk/multisite.d/wato/global.mk

log_levels = {
 'cmk.web'                : 50,

 'cmk.web.background-job' : 10,
 'cmk.web.bi.compilation' : 20,
 'cmk.web.ldap'           : 30,
}
----

In this file you can set the [.guihint]#User Interface# logging.

The amount of logged data increases inversely as the count decreases.
The lowest log level is 50 ([.guihint]#Critical#) while the most data will be logged at 10 which corresponds to the highest ([.guihint]#Debug#).

.~/etc/check_mk/liveproxyd.d/wato/global.mk
[{file}]
----
liveproxyd_log_levels = {'cmk.liveproxyd': 20}
----

This file is used for [.guihint]#Livestatus Proxy logging#.
The possible values here correspond to those for [.guihint]#User Interface# logging.

*Important*: Log files can quickly become very large if a high level has been set.
It is generally advisable to use such settings for a 'temporary' customization,
as an aid in problem identification for example.


[#cmk]
== The cmk command

Along with the xref:omd_basics#[`omd` command], which serves for starting
and stopping sites, for the basic configuration of components, and for starting a
xref:update#[software update], `cmk` is the most important command.
With this a configuration for a monitoring core can be created, checks executed manually,
a service discovery performed, and much more.


[#options]
=== The command options

The command `cmk` is actually an abbreviation for `check_mk`, introduced to make the command faster to type.
The command includes a built-in, very detailed online help, that can be called up with `--help` option:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -h
WAYS TO CALL:
 cmk  --automation [COMMAND...]          Internal helper to invoke Check_MK actions
 cmk  --backup BACKUPFILE.tar.gz         make backup of configuration and data
 cmk  --cap [pack|unpack|list FILE.cap]  Pack/unpack agent packages (Enterprise only)
 cmk  --check [HOST [IPADDRESS]]         Check all services on the given HOST
...
----

As you can see in the command above, we have called help with the option `-h` instead of `--help`.
Because what is true for the command itself is also true for its options: The less there is to type, the faster it goes.
Not for all options, but for those that are often needed, there is therefore a short form in addition to the long form.
Even though the long form is more intuitive, especially for beginners (`check_mk --list-hosts`) than the short form (`cmk -l`), we will use the short form in the User guide. If in doubt, you can always consult the command help.
A longer look in the command help is a good idea in any case, as we will not present all options in the User guide.

By entering an option, you start the command `cmk` in a certain mode.
Here follows the overview of the options we will present in this chapter, but also in other parts of the manual:

|`cmk -vv` |The same as the above, with even more details: ‘very verbose’
|`cmk --cache` |The information is read from cache files, even if they are out of date. The agent is only contacted if no cache file exists. The cached agent data of the host can be found under `tmp/check_mk/cache`.
|`cmk --no-tcp` |Works like `--cache`, however it will interrupt with if a cache file is absent or not current. Thus in any situation you can suppress an access to the agent.
|`cmk --no-cache` |The information is always fetched up to date, i.e. no cache files are used.
|`cmk --usewalk` |For SNMP hosts: instead of accessing the SNMP agent this uses a stored SNMP walk, that has been previously pulled with `cmk --snmpwalk myserver123`. These walks are stored in `var/check_mk/snmpwalks`.
|`cmk --debug` |If an error occurs, this option ensures that it will no longer be intercepted, rather the original Python exception will be displayed in full. This can be important information for the developer, by showing the exact program location in which the error is located. It will also be very helpful with locating errors in self-written check plug-ins.  If when invoking `cmk` an error is encountered which should be reported to support or feedback, repeat the request with the added `--debug` option, and attach the Python trace to your e-mail.
|===

In the following section we will show how the commands can be used.
The examples are mostly shown in an abbreviated form.


[#commands_core]
=== Commands for the monitoring core

The commercial editions utilizes the xref:cmc#[{CMK} Micro Core] (CMC) as its monitoring core,
the {CRE} uses Nagios. An important task for the `cmk` is the generation of a
configuration file that is readable for the core, and which contains all of the
configured hosts, services, contacts, contact groups, time periods, etc. On the
basis of this information the core knows which checks are to be executed and
which objects it should provide using the GUI's xref:livestatus#[Livestatus].

For Nagios as well as for the CMC, it is fundamental that the number of hosts,
services and other objects always remains static during the operation, and that
this number can only be altered through the generation of a new configuration,
followed by a reloading of the core. With Nagios a restart of the core is also
needed. The CMC has a very efficient function for the reloading of its
configuration during active processing.

The following table highlights important differences between the configurations of both cores:

[cols="20,45,~",options=header]
|===
| |Nagios |CMC
|Configuration file |`etc/nagios/conf.d/check_mk_objects.cfg` |`var/check_mk/core/config`
|File type |Text file with `define`-commands |Compressed and optimized binary file
|Activation |Core restart |Core command for reloading the configuration
|Command |`cmk -R` |`cmk -O`
|===

Regenerating the configuration is always necessary if the contents of the
configuration file in `etc/check_mk/conf.d`, or automatically-detected
services in `var/check_mk/autochecks` have been modified.
The Setup keeps a record of such changes and highlights them in the GUI as to xref:wato#activate_changes[activating changes].
Should you ‘bypass the Setup’ by modifying the configuration manually or with a script,
you will also need to attend to the activation manually.
The following commands serve this function:


[cols="35,~",options=header]
|===
|Option |Function

|`cmk -R` |Generates a new configuration for the core and restarts the core (analogous to `omd restart core`). This is the method provided for Nagios.

|`cmk -O` |Generates the configuration for the core and loads this without a restart of the active processing (analogous to `omd reload core`). This is the recommended variant with the CMC.

*Attention:* With Nagios as the core this option still functions, but it can lead to memory holes and other instabilities. Apart from that, this option does in any case not perform a genuine reload, rather it internally stops and restarts the process, as it were.

// |`cmk -C` |Only useful for Nagios: it generates new versions of the precompiled Python files in `var/check_mk/precompiled`, which greatly accelerates the operation of {CMK} during the monitoring. This procedure is included in `cmk -R`.

|`cmk -U` |Generates the configuration for the core _without_ activating it.
// Additionally, in Nagios the action `cmk -C` will be executed automatically.

// |`cmk -B` |Generates the configuration for the core _without_ activating it. With Nagios as the core, here `cmk -C` will _not_ also be executed.

|`cmk -N` |For diagnostic purposes, this outputs the configuration to be generated on the standard output, without altering the actual configuration file. Here you can enter a host's name simply in order to view the host's configuration (e.g. `cmk -N myserver123`).
|===


To summarize: If you want to customize a {CMK} configuration and activate
the changes, in Nagios you will subsequently require:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -R
----

And with the CMC:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -O
----


[#execute_checks]
=== Executing checks

A second mode in {CMK} deals with the execution of a host's {CMK}-based checks.
With this you can allow all automatically detected, and also manually configured
services, to be immediately checked, without needing to bother yourself with the
monitoring core or the GUI.

To do this, enter `cmk --check` followed by the name of a host configured in the monitoring.
Since the `--check` option is the default option of `cmk`, you can also omit it.
In addition, you should always add the two options `-n` (do not send results to the core) and `-v` (output all results).
More on this in the description of the options below.

[{shell}]
----

----

Further tips:

* Do not use this command in monitored production hosts which use log file monitoring. Log messages are only sent once by agents, and it can happen that a manual `cmk -nv` ‘catches’ these and that they will then be lost from the monitoring. In such a situation use the `--no-tcp` option.
* If Nagios is being used for the core and `-n` is omitted, the effect will be an immediate actualization of the check results in the core and in the GUI.
* The command is useful when developing your own check plug-ins, because it enables a quicker test than by using the GUI. If the check fails and returns an {UNKNOWN}, the `--debug` option can help to find the problem location in the code.

The following options influence the command:


[cols="35,~",options=header]
|===
|Option |Function
|`-v` |Check results output: Without this option you will only see the output from the service [.guihint]#Check_MK# itself, and not the results from the other services.

|`-n` |Dry run: Results are *not* passed to the core, the performance counter is not updated.

|`--detect-plugins=df,uptime` |Restricts the execution to the check plug-ins `df` and `uptime`. In the case of SNMP hosts, only the data required for these will be retrieved. This option is practical if you develop your own check plug-ins and only want to test these.

////
[#execute_discovery]
=== Executing a service discovery

An automatic service discovery can be started with `cmk -I` or `cmk -II`, and by specifying one or more hosts -- as always, so also here, additionally with the 'verbose' option `-v`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -vI myserver123
----

There are two modes for this:

[cols="15,~"]
|===
|`cmk -I` |Finds and adds missing services.
|`cmk -II` |Deletes all previously discovered services, and runs a complete new discovery.
|===

All of the applicable details for this theme can be found in the article on the xref:wato_services#commandline[services].
////

////
[#utilities]
=== Auxiliary commands

The `cmk` command has a number of modes that are useful generally for
diagnoses and troubleshooting. Here is an overview:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|`cmk -d myserver123` |Retrieves and outputs data from {CMK}-agents.
|`cmk -D myserver123` |Display the configuration overview of one or more hosts.
|`cmk --paths` |Important {CMK} directories: what is located where?
|`cmk -l` |Output the names of all configured hosts.
|`cmk --list-tag mytag` |Output the names of all configured hosts with the tag `mytag`.
|`cmk -L` |Output a list of all check plug-ins.
|`cmk -m` |Open an interactive catalog of documentation for check plug-ins.
|`cmk -M df` |Display documentation for the check plug-in `df`.
|===

In the following section we will show how the commands can be used.
The examples are mostly shown in an abbreviated form.
////



[#dump_agent]
=== Retrieving agent output

The command `cmk -d` retrieves and displays the output from a host's {CMK} agent.
With `cmk -d` agent data is retrieved in the same way as with the monitoring.
It is neither validated nor processed.
Thus the data showed exactly matches the data that is turned over to the Agent Controller (when TLS encryption is enabled) or to a tunneling program in case xref:datasource_programs#[datasource programs] are configured.

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -d myserver123

----

You can even run `cmk -d` using the name or IP address of a host that is not configured in the monitoring.
In this case legacy settings for the host will be assumed (TCP connection to port 6556, no Agent Controller, no encryption, no datasource program).


[#bake_agents]
=== Baking agents

In the commercial editions you can also bake the agents from the command line, as you would otherwise do via the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[web interface]. This gives you the option, for example, of updating the agents regularly, for example via a cronjob.

To bake the agents, use the option `-A` followed by the name of a host (or several):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -Av myserver123
myserver123...linux_deb:baking...linux_rpm:baking...(fast repackage)...solaris_pkg:baking...windows_msi:baking...linux_tgz:baking...(fast repackage)...solaris_tgz:baking...(fast repackage)...aix_tgz:baking...OK
----

The output shows that the agent packages available for the host `myserver123` have been successfully baked. If you do not specify a host, the packages will be baked for all hosts.

The command only bakes when necessary. If the packages are still up to date, the output will look something like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -Av myserver123
myserver123..linux_deb:uptodate...linux_rpm:uptodate...solaris_pkg:uptodate...windows_msi:uptodate...linux_tgz:uptodate...solaris_tgz:uptodate...aix_tgz:uptodate...OK
----

You can still force baking with the `-f` (_force_) option.


[#list_hosts]
=== Listing hosts

The `cmk -l` command simply lists the names of all hosts configured in the Setup:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -l
myserver123
myserver124
myserver125
----

Because the data is provided ‘naked’ and ‘unprocessed’, it is easy to use
in scripts – for example a loop across all host names can be constructed:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} for host in $(cmk -l) ; do echo "Host: $host" ; done
Host: myserver123
Host: myserver124
Host: myserver125
----

If, instead of `echo` you insert a command that performs something
meaningful, this can be really useful.

The `cmk --list-tag` invocation likewise outputs host names, but also offers
the possibility of filtering by xref:glossar#host_tag[host tags]. Simply enter a
host tag and you will receive all hosts having this tag. The following example lists
all hosts that are monitored by SNMP:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --list-tag snmp
myswitch01
myswitch02
myswitch03
----

Enter multiple tags and they will be linked with ‘and’.
The below command delivers all hosts that are monitored by both SNMP *and* {CMK} agents.
As no hosts fulfill this condition, the output remains empty:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --list-tag snmp tcp
----


[#dump_host]
=== Displaying host configuration

For one or more specified host, `cmk -D` displays the configured
services, host tags, labels and other attributes. Because the list of services is so
extensive it can look somewhat confusing on the terminal. Send the output
through `less -S` to avoid a break:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -D myserver123 | less -S

----

[#paths]
=== {CMK} path overview

The `cmk --paths` command displays in which directories {CMK} expects
which things. This list does not cover the complete {CMK} system,
rather only those things that the command line tool `cmk` itself works with.
Nonetheless it sometimes helps to locate things more quickly:

[{shell}]
----

----


[#info_plugins]
=== Information on the check plug-ins

{CMK} provides a large number of ready to use plug-ins as standard.
In every release a few new ones are added, and Version {v20} already includes around 2,000 plug-ins.
Three `cmk` command options give you access to information about these plug-ins.

`cmk -L` produces a table of all plug-ins with their name, type and a description.
At the same time, any self-written plug-ins stored in `local/` will also be listed.

The following are possible types:

[cols="20,~"]
|===
|`agent` |Evaluates the data from a {CMK} agent. This is (normally) retrieved via TCP Port 6556.
|`snmp` |Serves the monitoring of devices via SNMP.
|`active` |Calls a standard type of Nagios-compatible plug-in for the monitoring. Here {CMK} actually only adopts the configuration.
|===

The list can of course be filtered simply with `grep` if something specific is
being searched for:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -L | grep f5
f5_bigip_apm                      snmp  F5 Big-IP: Number of Current SSL/VPN Connections

f5_bigip_vcmpguests               snmp  F5 Big-IP: Show Failover States of all vCMP Guests Running on a vCMP Host
f5_bigip_vserver                  snmp  F5 Big-IP: Virtual Servers
----

If you want more information on a certain plug-in, documentation as manual page (or man page) can be called up with `cmk -M`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -M f5_bigip_pool
----

This produces the following output:

image::check_manpage_example.png[alt="Example of a check plug-in manual page."]

Using `cmk -m` with no further options will access a complete catalog of all check plug-ins man pages.

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -m
----

You can navigate interactively in this catalog:

image::cmk_commandline_manpage_catalog_level1.png[alt="Main menu for selecting a manual page.",width=65%]

image::cmk_commandline_manpage_catalog_level2.png[alt="Submenu for selecting a manual page.",width=65%]


[#config]
== Configuration without Setup

The xref:wato#[Setup menu] is a great configuration tool. There are however good reasons
to prefer a configuration with text files in the good, old Linux tradition.
If you are of the same opinion there is some good news:
{CMK} can be completely configured using text files. And since the [.guihint]#Setup# menu actions does no more
than process (this same) text files, this is not even an either/or situation.


=== Where is the documentation?

If you are expecting a comprehensive compendium covering the exact structure
of all of the configuration files used by {CMK}, we will unfortunately
have to disappoint you here. The complexity and diversity contained in the
configuration files is simply too much to describe completely in this User guide.

The following example shows an entire completed parameter set for the check plug-in
which monitors file systems in {CMK}. Because of the many parameters, the
screenshot is divided into two parts, and set in lower-case characters:

[{image-border}]
image::cmk_commandline_parameters_for_df_check.png[alt="Complete parameter set of the check plug-in for monitoring file systems."]

The corresponding passage in the configuration file looks like this (somewhat
more nicely formatted):

[{file}]
----
{ 'inodes_levels'      : (10.0, 5.0),
  'levels'             : (80.0, 90.0),
  'levels_low'         : (50.0, 60.0),
  'magic'              : 0.8,
  'magic_normsize'     : 20,
  'show_inodes'        : 'onlow',
  'show_levels'        : 'onmagic',
  'show_reserved'      : True,
  'subtract_reserved'  : False,
  'trend_mb'           : (100, 200),
  'trend_perc'         : (5.0, 10.0),
  'trend_perfdata'     : True,
  'trend_range'        : 24,
  'trend_showtimeleft' : True,
  'trend_timeleft'     : (12, 6)},
----

As can be seen, there are more than 10 different parameters, each with
its own individual logic. Some are configured using floating-point numbers,
(`0.8`), some with integers (`24`), some with
keywords (`'onlow'`), some with boolean values (`True`),
and others using tuples to code various combinations of these (`(5.0,
10.0)`).

This is just one example from over 2,000 plug-ins. And there are of course
other configurations possible as check parameters: One only needs to think
of time periods, Event Console rules, user profiles, and many more.

Of course that doesn't mean you cannot use text files as  configuration!
If you don't yet know the exact syntax for your chosen configuration task,
you only need the correct tool for it – and this tool we call *Setup*:

. Create a {CMK} test site.
. Use the [.guihint]#Setup# menu to configure the desired parameters.
. Locate the configuration file that has been changed as a result (more on this below).
. Carry over the exact syntax from the relevant section of this file in your production system.

You thus only need to know in which file Setup writes.

*Note:* When it comes to the names of directories, files or even file contents, you will often find the term `wato`. *WATO* is the abbreviation for Web Administration Tool: the {CMK} configuration tool up to and including version {v16}.
The function of WATO has been taken over by the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, or *Setup* for short, from version {v20} onwards. Although WATO has been (almost) completely replaced by Setup in the web interface, it lives on in the file system.


=== Which configuration file is used?

There is a practical command for finding out which file Setup has
just changed: `find`. By invoking ‘find’ with the following parameters
you can find all files (`-type f`) under `etc/` which have
been altered within the last minute (`-mmin -1`):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} find etc/ -mmin -1 -type f
etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/rules.mk
----

The basis of a configuration is always the `etc/check_mk` directory.
Below this is a subdivision into various domains, which generally apply to
a specific service.
At the same time each has a directory with the suffix `.d`,
under which all files with the suffix `.mk` will be read automatically
in _alphabetic order_.
In some there will also be a main file which is read first of all.
This is intended only for manual alteration, and is never modified by Setup.

=== Setup and configuration files

Below the `.d/` configuration directories there is always the subdirectory `wato`, e.g. `etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato`.
The Setup fundamentally only reads and writes here.
However, the service responsible for the configuration directory also reads the other files in "its" `.d` directory, if you have stored some manually-created files there. This means:

* If it is required that the manual configuration be visible and editable in the Setup, use the existing paths.
* If it is required that the configuration simply functions, but is not visible in the Setup, then use your own files externally to `wato/`.
* If it is required that the configuration be visible in the Setup, but not changeable, some of the files can be _locked_.


==== Locking files and folders

A common reason for manually creating configuration files without Setup is needing to import
hosts to be monitored from a Configuration Management Database (CMDB).
Here, in contrast to methods using the xref:rest_api#[REST API], you create the folders for the hosts with a script directly in `etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato` and in each case the file `hosts.mk` for the hosts contained in the folder and possibly also the file `.wato`, which contains the folder attributes.

If this import is not just a one-off, rather it is to be repeated regularly
because the CMDB is the leading system, it would be very impractical if your
users make any changes to the files using the Setup, as these will be lost with the
next import.

A `hosts.mk`-file can be locked by inserting a line for the `lock` attribute:

.hosts.mk
[{file}]
----
# Created by WATO
# encoding: utf-8

_lock = True
----

When opening this folder in the Setup, the following message is displayed above the Hosts list:

image::cmk_commandline_locked_host_attributes.png[alt="Message that editing of hosts in the folder is locked."]

All actions which would alter the `hosts.mk` file are thus locked in the GUI.
This does _not_ apply to the service discovery of course. A host's configured
services are stored in `var/check_mk/autochecks/`.

The folder attributes can also be locked.
This is done by an entry in the folder's `.wato` file: set the `lock` attribute to `True` in the file's dictionary:

..wato
[{file}]
----
{'title': 'My folder',
 'attributes': {},
 'num_hosts': 1,
 'lock': True,
 'lock_subfolders': False,
 '__id': '7f2a8906d3c3448fac8a379e2d1cec0e'}
----

If you also set the `lock_subfolders` attribute to `True`, you prevent the creation and deletion of subfolders.

Locking of other files – such as `rules.mk`, for example – is not currently possible.


=== The files syntax

In purely formal terms, all of {CMK}'s configuration files are written
in *Python 3* syntax. There are two types of files:

* Those which are _executed_ like a script by Python. Among these is, e.g., `hosts.mk`.
* Those which are read in as values by Python. Among these is, e.g., `.wato`.

The executable files can be recognized by their having variables which are substituted
for assignments with values (`=`). The other files usually contain a
Python dictionary which begin with an opening bracket `{`. Sometimes they are simple values.

If a non-ASCII character is required in a file (a German Umlaut (`ä`, `ö`, `ü`), for example),
the following comment must be coded in the first or second line:

.somefile.mk
[{file}]
----
# encoding: utf-8
----

A syntax error will otherwise occur when reading the file. For further tips on Python syntax
we recommend visiting a specialist site, for example:
link:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/[The Python Language Reference].

=== Checking configuration files

If you edit configuration files in `etc/check_mk/` manually, it is a good idea to have the configuration checked.
You can do this with the tool `cmk-update-config`, which is actually only executed automatically after a version update with `omd update`:

[{shell}]
[{shell},highlight=7]
----
{c-omd} cmk-update-config
...
Verifying Checkmk configuration...
 01/05 Cleanup precompiled host and folder files...
 02/05 Rulesets...
Exception while trying to load rulesets: Cannot read configuration file "/omd/sites/mysite/etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/rules.mk":
 '[' was never closed (<string>, line 44)

You can abort the update process (A) and try to fix the incompatibilities or try to continue the update (c).
Abort update? [A/c]
...

For example, in the excerpt above you can see the reference to an unclosed bracket.
