:title: Overview of API resources
:description: {CMK} offers several APIs as well as related articles and references. Here you will find an overview and tips for navigation.

[#intro]
== Introduction

{CMK} now offers a whole host of diverse interfaces, above all the REST API, with which you can do a great deal of what is also possible via the web interface.
However, there are also APIs for xref:glossar#check_plugin[check plug-ins], the hardware/software inventory, the xref:glossar#agent_bakery[Agent Bakery] and so on.
There are articles, references and other resources for all of these interfaces, distributed throughout this User Guide, the website and {CMK} itself.

In this article, we will provide an overview of all interfaces and resources and give some tips on general handling.
Many links in this article are redundant, as the information is intended to serve three different approaches or questions: 

- Which APIs does {CMK} provide?
- Which API-relevant articles can be found in the User Guide?
- What API-relevant resources are available in {CMK}?

The most important interface is undoubtedly the xref:rest_api#[{CMK} REST API], which can be used to do almost everything from a programming perspective that can also be performed via the web interface.

[TIP]
====
The interactive REST API GUI offers a quick, practical introduction to the REST API.
Here you can send and, optionally, modify predefined queries.
You can find the GUI in {CMK} itself via [.guihint]#Help > Developer resources > REST API interactive GUI#.

The second major interface is the _Plugin APIs_ for developing your own extensions.
Depending on your experience, you can start here with our xref:devel_intro#[introductory article] or the reference, which you can again find directly in {CMK} itself:
[.guihint]#Help > Developer resource > Plug-in API references#.

In the tables below you will find these APIs, but also less familiar interfaces, such as for the hardware/software inventory, sub-interfaces for check plug-in development, such as the explicit Graphing API, as well as _quasi-interfaces,_ such as the output format of xref:localchecks#[local checks], the simple, script-based precursor to full-blown plug-ins.
