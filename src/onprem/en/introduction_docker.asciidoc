:title: Installation as a Docker container
:description: Installing {CMK} in a Docker container is very easy with the official images. Read here how to use containers based on these images.

{related-start}
xref:intro_setup#[Setting up {CMK}]
{related-end}


[#basics]
== The basics

Docker allows you to install {CMK} within a lightweight, self-contained container environment.
In this article, we will guide you through the setting up of {CMK} in Docker, and show you some tricks that can make life with {CMK} in Docker easier.

[TIP]
====
{com} provides official Docker images, but has no control over the characteristics of the host system on which you set up the corresponding containers.
The known advantages and disadvantages of container environments apply here.
In special cases, unexpected performance issues may arise, for example if the host system's kernel is significantly newer or older than the kernel expected by the {CMK} installation in the container.
In such cases, additional `sysctl` settings may be necessary.
====


[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites    

To execute the commands presented in this article, you will need a working installation of link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine^] and have a basic understanding of how to use it.  

[IMPORTANT] 
==== 
The use of {CMK} based on the images presented here is only supported within Docker itself.
Other container environments compatible with Docker may work, but are not supported by {CMK}.
In such cases, you use them at your own risk and they are not recommended for productive environments.
====


[#acquire_cmk_docker_image]
== Obtaining a {CMK} image

To make it as easy as possible for you to use {CMK} as a container, we provide separate images for each {CMK} xref:glossar#edition[Edition] in various ways.
The images from the different sources for an edition are identical.

[#image_sources]
[cols="25,~,~,~"]

|===

When one of these images is started for the first time, not only will the appropriate container be executed, but a monitoring site named `cmk` will also be set up and started.
This will be ready for immediate login with the user `cmkadmin`.

[#license_notes]

{cce-only}
The official images for the commercial xref:glossar#edition[editions] of {CMK} are also freely available (in license state "Trial") on various platforms.

 
[#runtime_download]
=== Automatically download images when starting a container for the first time

If an Internet connection is available, the Docker Engine automatically searches Docker Hub for the image name you specify when creating a container.
If you expect a connection from your system to Docker Hub to be possible, you can jump directly to the section xref:container_start[Starting a {CMK} container].


[#manual_download]  
=== Downloading and preparing images manually    
The images can also be downloaded as archive files and stored on the system where you want to start the container.
This can be useful, for example, if your Docker host does not have an Internet connection when the container is started.
Download the desired image and transfer the file to your Docker host using your preferred method.
Then use `docker load -i` to make the image file available to the Docker Engine on your system:

[{shell}]

[#container_start]
== Starting a {CMK} container

You can start {CMK} images either with xref:docker-compose[`docker compose`] and a compose file or with xref:docker_container_run[`docker container run`], specifying a set of parameters.
Which option you choose depends on your specific usage case.


[#docker-compose]
=== Starting with `docker compose`

The following example shows the variant using `docker compose`, with which only a little setup effort makes it possible to start additional containers in parallel.

In the `compose.yaml` file, you use parameters to describe the desired properties for the Docker container to be started.
Several containers can also be described here, which are then started together.

The following example of a suitable `compose.yaml` file shows the parameters for starting a single {CMK} container.
The parameters contained and their values are explained below.

.compose.yaml
[{yaml},subs="attributes+"]
----
services:
  checkmk:
    image: "checkmk/{pkg-cre}:{current-major}-latest"
    container_name: "monitoring"
    environment:
      - CMK_PASSWORD=mypassword
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
    volumes:
      - monitoring:/omd/sites
    tmpfs:
      - /opt/omd/sites/cmk/tmp:uid=1000,gid=1000
    ports:
      - 8080:5000
      - 8000:8000
    restart: always

More information about the options used:

[#container_options]
[cols="40,~",options="header"]
|===
|Option |Description

| `checkmk:` | Self-defined descriptive name for the Docker service for which the {CMK} container is to be started.

| `image: "checkmk/{pkg-cre}:{current-major}-latest"` | Name of the {CMK} image in the format `<repository>:<tag>`.

You can read the names of existing images using the `docker images` command.

| `container_name: "monitoring"` | Self-chosen descriptive name for the container.
This name must be unique and may not be used a second time on the Docker node.

l|environment:
  - CMK_PASSWORD=mypassword
  - TZ=Europe/Berlin | Use the environment variable `CMK_PASSWORD` to specify the password for logging in as the `cmkadmin` user in the {CMK} site.
  You can change this password at any time by running `cmk-passwd cmkadmin` as the site user within the container.

  {nbsp}

  `TZ` is the time zone you set for the container. If you omit this setting, the container (and thus your {CMK} site) will automatically use UTC until you change the setting in the container.

If you do not want to set the time zone explicitly, you can alternatively adopt the time settings from the Docker host.
To do this, mount the file `/etc/localtime` located on the host as a volume in the container.
However, we recommend using the environment variable `TZ`, as this avoids possible platform-dependent compatibility issues when using `/etc/localtime`.

l|volumes:
  - monitoring:/omd/sites | This specification binds the site's data in this container to a persistent location in the file system of the Docker node.  
The volume named `monitoring` is mounted in the container in the path `/omd/sites`.  
Volumes are managed by the Docker Engine and can be viewed or modified with `docker volume`.  
If the container is removed, the data is not lost.

l|tmpfs:
  - /opt/omd/sites/cmk/tmp:uid=1000,gid=1000 | For optimal performance, you can use a temporary file system directly in the RAM of the Docker node.
With this option, you specify the path to this file system.
If you specify a different name when creating the site, this path must also be updated accordingly.

l|ports:
  - 8080:5000
  - 8000:8000 | The container's web server listens on port 5000 by default.
In this example, port 8080 of the Docker node is bound to port 5000 of the container so that its web interface is accessible from the outside.
If you do not have another container or process that uses the standard HTTP port 80, you can also bind the container to it.
In this case, the option would look like this: `80:5000`.
The use of HTTPS is explained in the section xref:https[HTTPS].
In addition, you must publish the port of the Agent Receiver in order to perform the xref:agent_linux#registration[registration of the Agent Controller], in case you want to include a host with an installed {CMK} agent in your monitoring.

{nbsp}

For certain scenarios that go beyond the basic functionality of {CMK}, additional ports must be explicitly enabled.
This applies, for example, to xref:livestatus#network[access to Livestatus via TCP] in xref:glossar#distributed_monitoring[distributed monitoring] or the use of xref:ec#setup[Event Console] within a {CMK} container.
An overview of the relevant ports can be found in the xref:ports#cmk_incoming_host_outgoing[Ports] article.

| `restart: always` | Normally, a container does not restart when it is stopped.
This option ensures that it does restart automatically.
However, if you stop a container manually, it will only restart when the Docker daemon restarts or the container itself is restarted manually.

l|volumes:
  monitoring: | All volumes required within services are specified here.
  In this case, this is only the `monitoring` volume.
|===

In addition to the `checkmk` Docker Compose service, in your `compose.yaml` file you can define additional services that are to be started in the same container group.

Once you have described everything as desired, you can create and start the container or containers.
To do this, run `docker compose up` in the directory where your `compose.yaml` file is located.
`docker compose up` ensures that all containers and their associated volumes are created properly.
With `docker compose up -d` (for _detached_), the containers are started in the background.

If you have not yet downloaded an image and stored it on your system, executing `docker compose up` will take a few minutes, as the specified image will be loaded from Docker Hub at this point.

[TIP]
====
If an image with the specified name already exists on your Docker host, no new image will be downloaded -- so your local image may already be out of date when you first start the container.
To ensure that you are working with the latest image, run `docker compose pull && docker compose up` (optionally with the `-d` parameter) to start the container.
====

The output here is based on a scenario in which the image was prepared with `docker load -i`.

----

Stop running containers with `docker compose stop`.
To restart containers that have already been created, run `docker compose start`.  

View the output of the `monitoring` container with `docker container logs monitoring`.  
With `docker inspect monitoring` get detailed information about the container -- the volumes it includes, for example.  


[#docker_container_run]
=== Start with `docker container run`

As an alternative to running with `docker compose`, you can start the {CMK} image with `docker container run`.
To do this, pass the information from the `compose.yaml` file as parameters.

The following command creates the same container with the same xref:container_options[properties] as in the example shown above.
The output shown is based on a scenario in which the image has not yet been downloaded manually.
Optionally, you can force the download of the latest image by prefixing `docker pull checkmk/{pkg-cre}:{current-major}-latest`.

[{shell}]
----

----

Here the container is run in _detached_ mode (`-d`).
To view the output from the container, use `docker container logs monitoring`.
For detailed information about the container, use `docker inspect monitoring`.

[#short-lived_containers]
[TIP]
====
When starting with `docker container run`, you have the option of specifying from the outset that the container and its volumes should be automatically removed after stopping.
The persistent data storage is created by the parameter `-v monitoring:/omd/sites`.
If you omit this option, no persistent storage will be created.
====


[#managing_docker]
=== Additional setup options
The examples shown so far are for the simple setup of {CMK} containers.
Several additional options are available for special application scenarios.


[#https]
==== HTTPS  

You can also xref:omd_https#[secure your site's web interface via HTTPS] within a Docker container.
The common practice for this is to use a _reverse proxy_, which acts as the interface for HTTP(S) connections between the containers in your system and the outside world.
This proxy can ensure that only HTTPS connections are accepted or passed on to the {CMK} container.

If you use a reverse proxy, do not explicitly enable any ports when starting your {CMK} container.
Instead, all incoming and outgoing connections will then be handled exclusively via the reverse proxy.


[#environment_variables]
==== Additional environment variables

The table shows all {CMK}-specific environment variables that you can use when starting the container to set up your container as desired.
To do this, specify the variable values in the compose file or in the parameter list when calling `docker container run` in the same form as the previously mentioned environment variables `CMK_PASSWORD` and `TZ`.

[cols="40,~"]
|===
| `CMK_SITE_ID` | Self-defined name of the {CMK} site to be created within the container, if you want to deviate from the default site name `cmk`.
| `CMK_LIVESTATUS_TCP` | Setting for using Livestatus via TCP.
If you select `on` as the value for this, the command xref:livestatus#network[`omd config set LIVESTATUS_TCP on`] is executed within the container for the site.
| `MAIL_RELAY_HOST` | Address of a mail relay server provided by you (e.g., `mailrelay.mydomain.com`) for sending {CMK} xref:glossar#notification[notifications].
Notifications are first forwarded by the site within the container to the mailserver specified here (SMTP relay server, smarthost without authentication) outside the container, from where they are then sent to the actual destination.
|===


[#login]
== Using {CMK} in the running container

Once all the necessary files have been loaded and the container has started, you should be able to access the {CMK} GUI via `\http://localhost:8080/cmk/check_mk/` or via the address of the Docker node:

image::login.png[alt="{CMK} login dialog.",width=60%]

You can now log in for the first time and xref:intro_gui#[try out {CMK}].
To do this, use the `cmkadmin` user and the password you chose when creating the container.
If your site has a name other than `cmk`, edit the name in the URL.

To access your site within the container via the command line, log in to the container as the site user.
In {CMK}, this user always has the same name as the site it manages.
Use the following command to open an interactive Bash session in the `monitoring` container and log in as user `cmk`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} docker container exec -it -u cmk monitoring bash
----

You can then pass your xref:cmk_commandline#[commands] to the site.


[#update]
== Update

How to update {CMK} in the Docker container is described in the article xref:update#updatedocker[Updates and Upgrades].


[#uninstall]
== Uninstallation

If you no longer need a container, you can remove it and, if necessary, delete its associated volumes.
The commands for this can be found in the following sections.


[#uninstall_docker_compose]
=== Uninstalling with `docker compose`

To remove a container, run `docker compose down` (with the container running) or `docker compose rm` (with the container stopped).

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} docker compose down
[+] Running 2/2
 [green]#✔# Container monitoring         Removed                    6.3s 
 [green]#✔# Network cmk_compose_default  Removed                    0.1s 
----

If you add the `-v` option, the associated volumes on the Docker node will also be removed along with the container.

[IMPORTANT] 
==== 
Only use the `-v` option if you are certain that you no longer need the configuration and monitoring data from the container's volumes.
There is no way to restore deleted volumes later if they have not been saved in regular backups.
====


[#uninstall_docker_container]
=== Uninstalling after starting with `docker container run`

You can stop a container named `monitoring` that was started with `docker container run` using `docker container stop monitoring`. You can then remove the container using `docker rm monitoring`. You can delete a volume named `monitoring` that you no longer need after removing its associated container using `docker volume rm monitoring`.


[#remove_cmk_image]
=== Deleting the {CMK} image

If you no longer wish to use the selected {CMK} image, you can remove it with `docker rmi myimageid`.
The command `docker images` lists all existing images.
Identify the image you want to delete and add the corresponding image ID to your call to `docker rmi`.
