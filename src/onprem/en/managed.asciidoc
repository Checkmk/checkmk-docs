== Introduction

In a typical distributed monitoring with a xref:distributed_monitoring#distr_wato[centralized Setup], as a rule a user will log in to the _central site_ 
in order to work with configurations or to access the monitoring data.
Users can additionally log in to the _remote sites_ since only they are responsible for the hosts and services monitored beyond that position.
The authorization concept in {CMK} which uses xref:wato_user#roles[roles] and xref:wato_user#contact_groups[contact groups] to control the visibility and configurability of hosts and services is quite satisfactory for both of these scenarios.
As a general rule users with very restricted authority will receive no direct access to the monitoring server's command line 
and thus will only see the data for which they themselves are responsible.
If in this process, the possibility that they may become aware of the existence of other hosts and services is not a problem.

With a centralized setup, under the {SE} and {CE} {CMK} will therefore distribute all configuration files to all participating sites, 
since in principle these sites could be located or be required anywhere, as the case may be.
Centrally-managed passwords must also be made available for the remote sites since the hosts and services in contact groups can be distributed over multiple sites.

When {CMK} is to be provided as a service to a third party however, specific configuration files are only permitted to be distributed to specified remote sites.
This means that sensitive customer data may not be stored on another customer's server 
-- a simple restriction of its visibility in the web interface is therefore insufficient.
In any event it is possible that the local monitoring server is run by the customer themselves, or that the customer otherwise has a direct access to the server's command line.

In addition it is no longer required that a customer makes configuration changes centrally 
-- after all, the whole point of providing such a service is to save the customer from needing to perform such tasks.
The customer also does not need a centralized overview since they only need access to their own data.

With the {CME}, via the xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring] in their central site, for each customer a provider links only the one or more local sites which belong to that customer.
Individual elements in [.guihint]#Setup# will then be assigned to these sites.
When distributing configuration data {CMK} will now only send data of a general nature or data that has been approved for the customer's site.
The service provider can still easily carry out a configuration over the central Setup in their own site.
Likewise a central web interface for all of the provider's customers is available in which they can work with monitoring data.
This works in exactly the same way as in a normal distributed environment with the only difference being that you must use the {CME} on all of the sites involved:

image::managed_distributed_monitoring_en.png[]

The following elements in {CMK} can be assigned to a customer:

* Remote sites
* Users
* LDAP connections
* Rules and rule packs in the xref:glossar#ec[Event Console]
* Centrally-managed passwords
* Contact groups
* Host and service groups
* Global settings for remote sites

Thus only the customer's own configuration, host and service data is available to the customer over the site assigned to that customer.
They need only to log in to their own site to receive their own data.
A login to the service provider's central server is no longer required -- and is in fact no longer possible!

*Important*: The [.guihint]#Managed Services# option in link:https://checkmk.com/pricing[licensing^] must be selected if {CMK} is not for your own use, but rather is intended for monitoring another business's infrastructure.
This also applies even if the extended functionality of the {CME} is not being used.


== Configurations

=== Installing customers

Installing one of your customers is performed simply in a single step:
in [.guihint]#Setup > Users > Customers# select the [.guihint]#Add Customer# button, and assign an explicit ID, as well as the name to be used when displaying it in {CMK}.
Once saved, your first customer will have been been installed in {CMK}:

image::managed_create.png[]

As can be seen the service provider will likewise be treated like a customer and for this reason has already been defined as a [.guihint]#Provider#.
You may not delete this assignment.


=== Assigning sites

Once a customer has been created, next link the appropriate {CMK} components to this customer.
The central site to which all of the customer's other sites send their data is also known as the _provider site_.
Currently separation of the data only functions if each customer has their own site assigned to them and this is in turn xref:distributed_monitoring#connect_remote_sites[connected] to your provider site.
The setup in this case differs at a single point:
in the [.guihint]#Basic settings#, in addition to the ID and the alias, the previously-defined customer is entered:

image::managed_sites.png[]

Thereby, since the provider is also handled like a customer, via the assignments to a site {CMK} always knows which host belongs to which customer.

*Note*: The customer site's [.guihint]#Global settings# can as usual be configured over the xref:distributed_monitoring#sitespecific[site-specific global settings].


=== Further assignments

Alongside the site itself -- as mentioned in the introduction -- you can also assign other elements from the [.guihint]#Setup# to a customer.
In doing so an element will be assigned directly to the customer.
Alternatively, you can also make it available to all customers globally.
Here is an example for a user:

image::managed_users.png[]

The assignment is always carried out via the properties of the respective elements using the [.guihint]#Customer# option.
Exceptions to this are the site-specific global settings.


==== Special features of the Event Console

In the xref:glossar#ec[Event Console] you can assign individual rules as well as complete rule packs to a customer.
In the process be aware that with rule packs the inheritance must always be performed.
They thus cannot be -- in contrast to folders -- overwritten by the individual rules.
In this way you can always be confident that every rule will be reliably assigned.

If a rule pack has not been assigned to any customer, its individual rules can be assigned to a customer as applicable.


=== Non-customizable components

All components that have not been discussed in the preceding can _not_ be assigned to individual customers.
Nevertheless, with a few words we will draw attention to some special features of various components.
Failure to follow these instructions may pose a moderate safety risk.


==== Business Intelligence

BI aggregations cannot be assigned to a specific customer.
Therefore all aggregations and their rules will be assigned to all sites.
For this reason the naming of rules, packs and aggregations should be as generalized as possible,
and accordingly should not contain customer-specific descriptions.

// In a future version of {CMK} it may become possible to also assign BI aggregations to an individual customer.
// Should this become the situation then the documentation will be updated appropriately.


==== Host tags

Likewise xref:glossar#host_tag[host tags] may not contain confidential information 
since the tags are distributed to all sites.


==== Notifications

Rules for xref:glossar#notification[notifications] often contain contact groups and very specific conditions under which the notifications should be triggered and sent.
Since these rules are also distributed to all sites, you should especially avoid using explicit host and service names, contact addresses and other sensitive data.


==== Customization of global users

Note that all customizations of global users will be passed on to all of the customer's sites.
Global users are therefore unsuitable for specialized views, custom graphs or bookmarks since these can contain sensitive, customer-specific data.
Utilize the global users for exceptional cases rather than for regular everyday tasks.


[#certificate_management]
=== Certificate management

The topics mentioned in the last chapter, such as notifications with contact groups or host tags might only leak information on organizational structures of other customers.

The situation is different with the distribution of CA (_Certificate Authority_) root certificates:
If a CA certificate intended for _customer A_ were distributed to _customer B_, there would be a risk that a rogue administrator at _customer A_ could carry out a _man in the middle_ attack on the encrypted communication at _customer B_.
For this reason, CA certificates stored with the [.guihint]#Trusted certificate authorities for SSL# global setting are _not_ synchronized to the remote sites.

The correct way to configure customer-specific CA certificates is to enter them in the xref:distributed_monitoring#sitespecific[site-specific global settings] for the customer's remote sites.


== Extended GUI

=== Dashboard

New on the [.guihint]#Main# xref:glossar#dashboard[dashboard] is the [.guihint]#Customers# dashlet located to the left of the service problems:

image::managed_dashboard.png[width=600]

On selecting a customer a view listing all of the customer's hosts will be opened.
This xref:glossar#view[view] functions like the [.guihint]#All hosts# view, 
with the difference here being that only the specific customer's elements are shown.


=== Sidebar

The [.guihint]#Customers# snap-in of the xref:glossar#sidebar[sidebar] functions in exactly the same way as the similar looking [.guihint]#Site status# snap-in.
Here the status of the individual customer's sites can be output, and with a click on a status particular customers can be hidden or shown in the display.

image::managed_snapin.png[width=370]

In contrast to the [.guihint]#Site status# snap-in, with this snap-in a single click hides *all* of a customer's sites.


=== Filtering and building views

Of course you can also use the filters and data sets for your own views in the same way as they are used in the dashlet and the snap-in.
On the one hand the [.guihint]#Site# filter has been extended to xref:views#using_views[modify what is being displayed]:

image::managed_filter.png[width=60%]

And on the other hand you can build completely xref:views#new[new views] based on one or all customers.
For this purpose select [.guihint]#All customers# as the data source:

image::managed_customer_view.png[]


== Tips for upgrades

=== Introduction

When upgrading an existing environment from the {SE} to the {ME} there are a number of particulars to be aware of.
If you only want to switch a single site the transition is very easy:
perform an xref:update#detailed[update] of the site in the usual way, after which all of the important tasks will have been completed.
All hosts, users and other settings that were previously configured will be assigned to the [.guihint]#Provider# customer, 
so that your monitoring will for the time being function as before.
Then in your own good time you can construct an environment for the Managed Services.

If the upgrade is to an existing environment in which remote sites have already been defined for a customer, there are a couple of more points to consider.


=== Sequence for updates of individual sites

Following the update all of the functions will be available for defining customers and for assigning sites, users, etc. to them.
As already mentioned these will in fact be assigned to the [.guihint]#Provider#.
In an existing xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring] this however also means that all other sites with this data cannot yet use it.
The following sequence should therefore be followed to complete a safe update:

* *First* update all remote sites.
* Update the central site *last*.
* To be safe, make *no* changes while the update procedure is processing.

To securely prevent any changes from occurring, these can be disabled for the duration of the update process.
This lock is activated in the [.guihint]#Setup > General > Read only mode#:

image::managed_read_only.png[]

By the way, with an update in a distributed monitoring all of the compatible components in {CMK} will be assigned to the Provider.


=== Assignment of customers

Following the update the sites can be assigned to the customers.
Be aware of possible dependencies that could result from the existing configuration, 
and assign the correct elements from {CMK}'s other components to the customers as appropriate before activating the assignments to a site.

*Important*: At least one user must be transferred to a customer's site.
It makes no difference whether it is a global user to be replicated on all sites or if it is a customer-specific user.
