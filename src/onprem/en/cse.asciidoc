[#intro]
== Introduction

There can't be just one solution for all, and if you are paying for a software subscription, you will want to pay only for features that you actually use.
For this reason, {CMK} offers various editions for different areas of application.
In this article we will introduce you to {CSE}, one of the commercial xref:glossar#edition[editions] most commonly encountered in professional environments.


[#editions]
== Overview of {SE}

Based on the fully Open Source variant, {CRE}, {SE} most importantly offers performance improvements, more extensive possibilities for _dashboards_ as well as _reporting_ and facilitates _automation_.
It thereby addresses above all professional users, who put subscription costs against reduced hardware costs and reduced expenditure for the production of own extensions.
In addition, {SE} provides various options for booking support with guaranteed response times.

xref:cce#[{CCE} (Self-hosted)] in turn builds on {SE}.

Complementing the link:https://checkmk.com/pricing[edition comparison^] on our website, this article explains the differences on a technical level and thus tries to be a complementary support for decision making when choosing a {CMK} edition.

Furthermore, this should help to determine which configuration changes may be necessary or useful when xref:update#[changing an edition] -- no matter whether an upgrade or a downgrade is to be performed.


[#functions]
== Additional functions

The main features of {SE} that distinguish it from {CRE}:

* Performance improvements: +
With the _Checkmk Micro Core (CMC)_, {SE} uses a monitoring core that utilizes memory and CPU more efficiently.

* Facilitates distributed monitoring: +
A number of enhancements facilitate distributed monitoring.
These include the possibility of completely centralizing the configuration, to handle notifications entirely via the central site, and various techniques to ensure the reliable transfer of monitoring data even in slow or unstable networks.

* Business features: +
Where IT is business critical, monitoring must help document, classify and prevent problems.
For this purpose, {SE} offers _predictive_ functions such as setting up recurring scheduled downtimes, and _evaluative_ functions such as generating availability reports -- the latter also for complex systems consisting of a large number of components.


[#upgrade]
== Upgrading to {SE}

You can upgrade {RE} to {SE} at any time.
To do so, follow the description for an xref:update#updateraw[upgrade] to {SE}.

If you have tested {CMK} with {CE} (Self-hosted), which is not limited for the first 30 days, you can also upgrade to {SE} permanently after the trial period.
To do so, follow the description for a xref:update#cce2cee[downgrade] to {SE}.


[#details]
== Differences of the components in detail

[#core]
=== The monitoring core


This section covers differences in the monitoring core and the transfer of monitoring data in distributed environments.
Users migrating from Nagios environments to {CMK} should carefully read the xref:cmc#[{CMK} Micro Core] and xref:cmc_differences#[Special characteristics of the CMC] articles to assess whether it may be appropriate to run {CMK} with the Nagios core for a transition period.

[cols="20,~",options="header"]
|===
|Function |Description
|CMC |The commercial editions by default use the xref:cmc#[{CMK} Micro Core], which is more performant than other monitoring cores by reducing to essential functionality and optimizing it.
|Alert handler |The CMC does not support _Nagios Event Handler_, but provides the more flexible xref:alert_handlers#[alert handler].
|Smart Ping |The xref:cmc_differences#smartping[Smart Ping] ensures more efficient and faster detection of whether hosts are reachable.
|CMCDump |This transfer technique simplifies xref:distributed_monitoring#livedump[distributed monitoring] in environments with unreliable network connectivity. In environments with the Nagios core Livedump is available instead.
|Livestatus proxy | The xref:distributed_monitoring#livestatusproxy[Livestatus proxy] optimizes performance and latencies in distributed monitoring. 
|Distributed HW/SW inventory |The automatic synchronization of inventory data in xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring] makes inventory data centrally available.
|RRD storage format |When using the CMC, {CMK} uses a Round Robin Database (RRD) storage format xref:cmc_differences#metrics[optimized for saving disk I/O].
|Parent-child relation |CMC allows {CMK} to more accurately xref:monitoring_basics#parents[determine the state of dependent hosts] in environments with parent-child topology.
|Flapping detection |In the commercial editions, a xref:notifications#flapping[fine-tuning of flapping detection] is possible for hosts and services whose status changes repeatedly at short intervals.
|===


[#ui]
=== The monitoring interface

[cols="20,~",options="header"]
|===
|Function |Description
|Standard dashboard |By default the commercial editions use a xref:dashboards#usage[dashboard], which is not available in {RE}. The latter uses the problem dashboard instead.
|Measured values and graphing |Advanced xref:graphing#[graphing functions] are only available in the commercial editions. These include: Scope of dashlets, PDF export, graph collections, customizations (_graph tunings_), embedding in reports or dashboards, and custom graphs.
|Kubernetes and OpenShift dashboards |The xref:monitoring_kubernetes#dashboards[Kubernetes dashboards] are available only in the commercial editions.
|Scheduled downtimes |Only in the commercial editions regularly recurring xref:basics_downtimes#[scheduled downtimes] can be specified. In addition, convenient xref:commands#commands[changing or removing one or more scheduled downtimes] is possible via _commands_.
|PDF export of availability data |xref:availability#[Availability data] can also be exported as a PDF in the commercial editions.
|PDF export of views |Direct PDF export of xref:views#[views] in monitoring is available only in the commercial editions.
|Reporting |xref:reporting#[Reporting] is available only in the commercial editions.
|Extended availability (SLAs) |The xref:sla#[extended availability / service level agreements] included only in the commercial editions facilitate the control of contractual agreements regarding the availability of services.
|Acknowledgment with validity period |The xref:basics_ackn#[acknowledgment of problems] can be assigned a maximum validity period in the commercial editions.
|===


[#notifications]
=== Notifications

[cols="20,~",options="header"]
|===
|Function |Description
|Notification spooler| The commercial editions include the xref:notifications#async[notification spooler], a component that allows more efficient and flexible delivery of notifications.
|Trackable delivery |xref:notifications#syncsmtp[Smarthost settings] can be used in the commercial editions to ensure that notifications arrive more reliably than by just handing them over to {RE}'s local mail system.
|Centralized notifications |In distributed monitoring, the commercial edition's notification spooler can be configured to send xref:distributed_monitoring#notifications[notifications from  remote sites for all targets].
|===


[#agents]
=== The monitoring agents

[cols="20,~",options="header"]
|===
|Function |Description
