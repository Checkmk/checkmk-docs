[#intro]
== Introduction

{CMK} usually accesses monitored hosts in the xref:glossar#pull_mode[pull mode] via a TCP connection to port 6556.
Starting with version {v21}, in most cases the Agent Controller listens on this port, which forwards the agent output over a TLS encrypted connection.
{CCE} {v22} introduced the alternative option for selecting the transmission direction with the new xref:glossar#push_mode[push mode].

There are environments however -- for example, stripped-down containers, legacy or embedded systems -- in which the Agent Controller cannot be used.
In such cases the _legacy mode_ is applied in which `(x)inetd` executes the agent script after establishing a connection, the agent output is transferred as plain text and the connection is closed immediately after.

In many situations security policies could require that actions such as the transmission of data as plain text must be avoided.
For example, the fill levels of file systems might be of little use to an attacker, but process tables or lists of missing updates could help in targeting an attack.
Moreover the practice of opening additional ports should be avoided in favor of using existing communication channels.

The universal methods for connecting such transfer procedures to {CMK} are the _datasource programs_.
The idea is very simple:
one passes a command as text to {CMK}.
Instead of connecting to port 6556, {CMK} executes this command.
This produces the agent data on the _standard output_, which is then processed by {CMK} in exactly the same way as if it had come from a ‘normal’ agent.
Since changes to data sources usually only affect transports, it is important that you leave the host to [.guihint]#API integrations if configured, else {CMK} agent# in the xref:hosts_setup#monitoring_agents[Setup GUI].

The modularity of {CMK} helps you to fulfill these requirements by transmitting the plain text agent output over arbitrary means of transport.
Ultimately, the plain text output of the agent script can be transported by any means -- direct or indirect, pull or push.
Here are a few examples on how to get agent data to the {CMK} server:

* via email
* via HTTP-access from the server
* via HTTP-upload from the host
* via access to a file that has been copied to the server using `rsync` or `scp`
* via a script that uses HTTP to retrieve the data from a web service

Another area of application for datasource programs are systems that do not allow agent installation but issue status data via REST API or a Telnet interface.
In such cases, you can write a datasource program that queries the existing interface and generates agent output from the data obtained.


[#writing]
== Writing datasource programs

=== The simplest possible program

The writing and installation of a datasource program is not difficult.
Any Linux-supported script and program language can be used.
The program is best stored in the `~/local/bin/` directory, where it will always be found automatically without the need to specify a data path.

The following first very basic example is called `myds` and it generates simple, fictional monitoring data.
Instead of integrating a new transport path, it generates the monitoring data itself. 
These consist of one section `+<<<df>>>+`, which contains the
information for a single file system, and which has a size of 100 kB and the name `My_Disk`.
It is coded as a shell script of three lines:

.~/local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/sh
echo '<<<df>>>'
echo 'My_Disk  foobar  100 70 30  70% /my_disk'
----

Don't forget to make the program executable:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} chmod +x local/bin/myds
----

Now create a test host in the Setup – e.g., `myserver125`.
This does not require an IP address.
In order to avoid {CMK} attempting to resolve `myserver125` via DNS, enter this name as an explicit ‘IP address’.

Next add a rule in the [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Other integrations > Individual program call instead of agent access# rule set which applies to this host, and enter `myds` as an executable program:

image::ds_program.png[alt="Input mask for an individual command."]

When you now go to the host's service configuration in the Setup GUI, exactly one service ready to start monitoring should be listed:

image::ds_program_discovery.png[alt="The new service has been detected."]

Add this service into the monitoring, activate the changes, and your first datasource program will be running.
For a test, as soon as you alter the data being generated by the program the `My_Disk` file system's next check will immediately show this.


=== Error diagnosis

If something is not functioning correctly, the host's configuration can be checked by entering `cmk -D` in the command line and see if your rule takes effect:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -D myserver125

myserver125
Addresses:              myserver125
Tags:                   [address_family:ip-v4-only], [agent:cmk-agent], [criticality:prod], [ip-v4:ip-v4], [networking:lan], [piggyback:auto-piggyback], [site:mysite], [snmp_ds:no-snmp], [tcp:tcp]
Host groups:            check_mk
Agent mode:             Normal Checkmk agent, or special agent if configured
Type of agent:
Program: #myds#
----

With a `cmk -d` you can trigger the retrieval of the agent data as well as the execution of your program:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -d myserver125
<<<df>>>
My_Disk  foobar  100 70 30  70% /my_disk
----

A duplicated `-v` should generate a message that your program will be invoked:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -vvd myserver125
Calling: myds
<<<df>>>
My_Disk  foobar  100 70 30  70% /my_disk
----


=== Transferring a host's name

The program in our example actually works, but is not very useful as it always produces the same data, regardless of which host it is invoked for.

A real program that, for example, retrieves data via HTTP from somewhere, requires at least the name of the host from where it should retrieve the data.
By coding `$HOSTNAME$` as a placeholder in the command line you can allow this to be transferred:

image::ds_program_host.png[alt="Passing the host name with the $HOSTNAME$ macro."]

In this example the program `myds` receives the host name as its first argument.
The following program example produces this for testing in the form of a xref:localchecks#[local check].
Via `$1` it takes the first argument and saves it for use as an overview in the `$HOST_NAME` variable.
This will then be inserted into the local check's plug-in output:

.~/local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/sh
HOST_NAME="$1"

echo '<<<local>>>'
echo "0 Hostname - My name is ${HOST_NAME}"
----

The service discovery will then find a new service of the `local` type, in the output from which the host name will be seen:

image::ds_program_discovery_host.png[alt="The service discovery finds the new service, which now outputs the passed host name as information."]

From here it is only a small step to a real datasource program that, for example, retrieves data over HTTP using the `curl` command.
The following placeholders are permitted in a datasource program's command line:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|`$HOSTNAME$` |The host name as configured in the Setup.
|`$HOSTADDRESS$` |The IP address of the host over which it will be monitored.
|`$_HOSTTAGS$` |The list of all xref:glossar#host_tag[host tags], separated by blank characters – enclose this argument in quotes to prevent it being split by the shell.
|===

If you have a dual-monitoring using IPv4 and IPv6, the following macros may be interesting for you:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|`$_HOSTADDRESS_4$` |The host's IPv4-address
|`$_HOSTADDRESS_6$` |The host's IPv6-address
|`$_HOSTADDRESS_FAMILY$` |The numeral `4` if the IPv4-address is used for the monitoring, otherwise `6`.
|===


=== Error handling

Regardless of your actual occupation in IT -- much of your time will be spent dealing with errors and problems.
Datasource programs are not spared these.
Especially for programs that provide data over networks it is unrealistic to expect them to be error-free.

In order that {CMK} can communicate an error to your program in an orderly way, the following apply:

. Any exit code other than `0` will be treated as an error.
. Error messages are expected on the standard error channel (`stderr`).

If a datasource program fails,

* {CMK} discards the output's complete user data,
* {CMK} sets the {CMK} service to {CRIT} and identifies the data from `stderr` as an error,
* and the actual services remain in their old state (and will become stale over time).

We can modify the above example so that it simulates an error.
With the redirection `&gt;&amp;2` the text will be diverted to `stderr`, and `exit 1` sets the program's exit code to `1`:

.~/local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/sh
HOST_NAME=$1

echo "<<<local>>>"
echo "0 Hostname - My name is $HOST_NAME"

echo "This didn't work out" >&2
exit 1
----

As a {CMK} service it will look like this:

image::ds_program_error.png[alt="If a script returns exit codes different from 0, the service will immediately CRIT (red)."]

Should you be writing your program as a shell script, right at the beginning you can code the `set -e` option:

.~/local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/sh
set -e
----

As soon as an instruction produces an error (i.e., exit code not `0`), the shell immediately stops and issues the exit code `1`.
You have thus a generic error handling and must not check every single instruction for success.


[#specialagents]
== Special agents

A number of often-required datasource programs are delivered with {CMK}.
These generate agent outputs not just by calling a normal {CMK} agent in a roundabout way, rather they have been specially conceived for the querying of particular hardware or software.

Because these programs sometimes require quite complex parameters, we have defined special rule sets in the Setup GUI that allow you to configure them directly.
You can find these rule sets grouped by use cases under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > VM, cloud, container# and [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Other integrations#.

.Rule sets under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Other integrations#
image::ds_program_rules.png[alt="Rule sets for monitoring applications by datasource and piggyback."]

[TIP]
====
Those who have switched from older {CMK} versions may be surprised by the new grouping:
{CMK} {v20} no longer groups according to access technique, but by type of monitored object.
This is particularly useful because in many cases the user is not interested in which technique is used to retrieve data and, moreover, data sources and xref:piggyback#[piggyback] are often combined, so no clear delimitation is possible here.
====

These programs are also known as _special agents_, because they are a _special_ alternative to the normal {CMK} agents.
As an example, let us take the monitoring of _NetApp Filers_.
These do not allow the installation of {CMK} agents.
The SNMP interface is slow, flawed and incomplete.
There is however a special HTTP interface which provides access to the NetApp _Ontap_ operating system and all of the monitoring data.

The `agent_netapp_ontap` special agent accesses this interface via a REST API and is set up as a data source program using the [.guihint]#NetApp via Ontap REST API# rule set.
The data required by the special agent can then be entered into the rule's content.
This is almost always some sort of access data.
With the NetApp special agent there is also an additional check box for the recording of metrics (which here can be quite comprehensive):

image::ds_program_netapp.png[alt="Rule for configuring the NetApp special agent."]

It is important that you leave the host set to [.guihint]#API integrations if configured, else {CMK} agent# in the xref:hosts_setup#monitoring_agents[Setup GUI].

There are rare occasions in which it is desired that both a special agent, as well as the normal agent are to be queried.
An example for this is the monitoring of xref:monitoring_vmware#[VMware ESXi] over the vCenter.
This latter is installed on a (usually virtual) Windows machine, on which reasonably enough a {CMK} agent is also running.

image::ds_program_vcenter.png[alt="Query type options in the VMware ESXi configuration."]

The special agents are installed under `~/share/check_mk/agents/special/`.
If you wish to modify such an agent, first copy the file with the same name to `~/local/share/check_mk/agents/special/` and make your changes in that new version.
