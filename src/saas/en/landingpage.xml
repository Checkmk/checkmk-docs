<div class="paragraph"><p><b>Dear reader</b><br />
We are pleased that you have found Checkmk Cloud.
</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
Checkmk Cloud provides you with Checkmk as <i>Software as a Service (SaaS)</i> in the cloud.
You can learn what makes Cloud (SaaS) different, also in comparison to its self-hosted siblings such as Checkmk Cloud (Self-hosted), in its  <a href="./cce.html">own article</a>.
</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
As a monitoring software, Checkmk provides comprehensive and specialized solutions for dealing with the very diverse environments within IT infrastructures.
This inevitably requires a very comprehensive documentation which goes beyond the mere description of the obvious.
Our User Guide will help you as much as possible to better understand Checkmk, to implement solutions for your requirements with Checkmk, as well as helping you to learn new approaches to solving problems.
</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
To make the handling of Checkmk as easy as possible, the articles in this User Guide follow rather unusual approaches in many places.
It is almost never a matter of simply following a prefabricated sequence of individual steps.
Rather, it is intended to give you, the reader, a deeper understanding of a feature in Checkmk.
</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
To briefly summarize, our most important intention is that the User Guide should be helpful.
And it is most helpful when you can make use of our descriptions as blueprints for implementation and for solving problems in your own environment.
