:description: The admin panel is the central point for managing {CE} (SaaS). Here you can set up sites and users, for example.

{related-start}
xref:user_interface#[The user interface]
{related-end}


[#intro]
== Introduction

The admin panel is the central interface for the administration of {CE} (SaaS).
Here you will find all of the configuration options that are specific to {CE} and which therefore are not accessible in the {CMK} user interface.
For example, you can manage sites and users in the admin panel.


[#open]
== Accessing the admin panel

The admin panel is opened via link:https://saas-auth.checkmk.cloud/[https://saas-auth.checkmk.cloud/^].
If you are not yet logged in to {CE}, first enter the email address as the user name and the password in the [.guihint]#Login# dialog box.
You can find out how to create a user name and password in the xref:intro_setup#signup_trial[Beginner's Guide]. 
If you are already logged in, the admin panel will be displayed immediately.

From the {CMK} interface, open the admin panel by clicking on the [.guihint]#Admin# icon in the xref:glossar#navigation_bar[navigation bar].

.After starting, the admin panel shows the page for managing the sites:
image::admin_panel_saas.png[alt=“The admin panel with its overview of the sites.”]

The page heading shows the name of the _tenant,_ in this example `My Organization`.
This is the name of the organization that you entered during xref:intro_setup#login_first[first login].
The functions are then selected via the navigation bar in the admin panel.


[#navigation_bar]
== The navigation bar

[{image-left}]

image::admin_panel_navbar_saas.png[alt=“{CMK} navigation bar.”,width=70px]

Just like the {CMK} interface, the admin panel also has a navigation bar on the left-hand side.
Use the icons to decide which part of the {CE} administration you want to access:

[.guihint]#Sites# -- the xref:admin_site[site management],

[.guihint]#User Management# -- the xref:admin_user[user management],

[.guihint]#Licensing# -- the xref:admin_license[license management].

The content of the admin panel's main page will change depending on your selection in the navigation bar.

In the [.guihint]#Help# menu at the bottom of the navigation bar, you will find a number of entries that you can use to call up documentation and information
-- including this User Guide.

In the [.guihint]#User# menu you will find the user name under which you are logged in.
In this menu, you can [.guihint]#Logout# of the admin panel.
In the navigation bar of the {CMK} interface, you will also find a [.guihint]#Logout# menu entry in the [.guihint]#User# menu.
As the admin panel and {CMK} have independent sessions, logging out of {CE} will not be complete until you have logged out of both sessions.

The {CMK} logo completes the navigation bar at the top. 
Clicking on the logo always takes you back to site management.


[#admin_site]
== Managing sites

To open the page for the management of {CMK} xref:glossar#site[sites], click [.guihint]#Sites# in the admin panel navigation bar:

.The site administration page with opened [.guihint]#More# menu
image::admin_panel_sites.png[alt=“Admin panel with the page for site management.”]

This is followed by the table of sites.
The name, status, installed {CMK} version and region are displayed for each site.
The status [.guihint]#RUNNING# shows that the site is active and that you can switch to it.

You can perform the actions as described in the following sections.


[#site_details]
=== Displaying site information

Click on [.guihint]#More# in the line for the site and then on [.guihint]#Site details.#
This entry opens a dialog box in which you will find, among other things, the URL with which you can call up the {CMK} interface for this site.


[#site_open]
=== Opening a site in {CMK}

Click on the site's name.
The {CMK} interface for the site will open in a new browser tab.


[#site_create]
=== Creating a site

It is currently only possible to create a maximum of one site in {CE}.
You can therefore only create a new site if the site table is empty, i.e. if you have deleted an existing site.

Click [.guihint]#Create site#:

image::admin_panel_create_site.png[alt=“Dialog box for creating a site.”,width=74%]

In the dialog box, enter the name of the site to be created.
Next, select the region in which the site is to be hosted, e.g. the EU or the USA.
Note that the actual {CE} administration data -- i.e. the data created with the admin panel -- is always saved in the EU.
Finally, select the time zone and confirm with [.guihint]#Create site#.

The dialog box will close and a new line for the site will be displayed on the main page.
The status of the site will initially be [.guihint]#STARTING UP#, which will change to [.guihint]#RUNNING# after the site has been started.


[#site_update]
=== Updating a site

{CE} automatically updates the site for you to a new patch version, e.g. from {v23}p27 to {v23}p28.

However, manual work may be required after an automatic update. 
If there are incompatible changes following a site update, their number will be displayed in the {CMK} interface, in the icon of the [.guihint]#Help# menu in the {CMK} xref:glossar#navigation_bar[navigation bar].

An incompatible change means that you should _eventually_ modify or at least check your configuration after an update.
A typical example of this is new xref:glossar#check_plugin[check plug-ins] which replace existing plug-ins.
If you use one of the affected plug-ins, after an update a new xref:glossar#service_discovery[service discovery] will be required on the affected hosts.

If you open the red highlighted link in the [.guihint]#Help# menu, you will only see the xref:glossar#werk[Werks] (i.e. the changes) where something needs to be done and which are therefore marked with [.guihint]#Incompatible - TODO#.
You can call up each Werk individually, view it, confirm it with a mouse click -- and thus successively reduce the number of open, incompatible changes.
In addition, the menu item [.guihint]#Help > Change log (Werks)# gives you access to the complete history of changes in the current _major_ version, e.g. in version {v23}.


[#site_delete]
=== Deleting a site

Click [.guihint]#Delete#, carefully read the information in the confirmation dialog and confirm the deletion if you are sure.


[#backup_create]
=== Creating a backup

Click [.guihint]#Backup# in the line for the site and confirm the request.
While the backup process is running, the site's status shows [.guihint]#BACKUP IN PROGRESS#.


[#backup_show]
=== Displaying backups

Click on [.guihint]#More# in the line for the site and then on [.guihint]#Show backups.#
You will see a table with all available backups for this site, i.e. those that you have created yourself (backup type [.guihint]#MANUAL#), and those created automatically by {CE} (backup type [.guihint]#SCHEDULE#).

A backup always belongs to the site for which it was created.
This means that you cannot restore a backup to another site, even if the site names are identical.


[#backup_restore]
=== Restoring a backup

Open the table of backups with [.guihint]#More > Show backups.#
Click [.guihint]#Restore# in the line for the backup you want to restore and confirm the prompt.
While the backup is being restored, the status of the site shows [.guihint]#RESTORING BACKUP#, and then [.guihint]#STARTING UP# when the site restarts.


[#admin_user]
== Managing users

To open the user management page, click on [.guihint]#User management# in the admin panel's navigation bar:

.The user management page
image::admin_panel_user_management.png[alt=“Admin panel with the user management page.”]

User management with the tasks described in the following sections can only be accessed by administrators, i.e. users with the [.guihint]#Administrator# role.

[TIP]
====
In the article on xref:wato_user#[user administration] you can find out how to edit the users set up in the admin panel in the {CMK} interface, e.g. by assigning contact groups to them.
====


[#user_create]
=== Creating users

Click [.guihint]#Add user#, enter the new user's email address and select a xref:intro_users#roles[role].

An email with the invitation to log in is sent to the specified email address.
This email contains the user name (i.e. the email address), a temporary password and a link to the first login to {CE}.
Until the new user logs in for the first time, their status will remain [.guihint]#INVITE PENDING.#


[#user_resend_invitation]
=== Send invitation email again

In the line for a user with the [.guihint]#INVITE PENDING# status, click [.guihint]#More#, and then [.guihint]#Resend invitation.#


[#user_edit]
=== Edit user

An administrator can change a user's role.
Click on [.guihint]#Edit# in the line for the user.

As an administrator, you cannot edit your own user account.
This is to prevent the -- possibly only -- administrator role from being revoked and there no longer being an administrator for the site.

Every user of {CE} can change their own password.
When logging in, in the xref:intro_setup#login_first[[.guihint]#Login#] dialog box there is a [.guihint]#Forgot Password?# link.
After entering the desired email address, an email is sent with a link to enable you to select a new password.


[#user_remove]
=== Deleting users

Click on [.guihint]#Remove# in the line for a user.

You cannot delete your own user account.


[#admin_license]
== Managing licenses

To license {CE} from the test phase (license status 'Trial'), you will require a subscription.
Once you have purchased the subscription, you will receive an activation key which you enter in {CE}.
This is all you need to do.

The licensable unit is the _tenant_, which includes the sites and users that can be created and managed in the admin panel.
The xref:open[main page] of the admin panel shows the name of the tenant as its heading.

To open the licensing page, click on [.guihint]#Licensing# in the admin panel navigation bar:

.The license management page in the 'Trial' license status
image::admin_panel_licensing_trial.png[alt=“Admin panel with the license management page in the 'Trial' license status.”]

The license management with the actions described in the following sections can only be accessed by administrators, i.e. users with the [.guihint]#Administrator# role.

It will still be possible to purchase the subscription and enter the activation key after the 14-day trial period has expired.
Although the site will be deleted after 14 days, later you will still be able to log in to {CE} and carry out the licensing actions described below via the admin panel.


[#license_buy]
=== Buying a license

The first step to buy a subscription is to click [.guihint]#Buy license.#
This will redirect you to the link:https://checkmk.com/pricing/cloud[{CMK} website^] where you can request a quote for {CE}.
Requesting a quote is the start of the order process, in which you will receive the quote and, once you have accepted it, an order confirmation.

You will also receive an email with the access data for the link:https://portal.checkmk.com/web/login[{CMK} customer portal^], and a second email with the activation key.

[TIP]
====
Note that the email address used in the order process and the account in the {CMK} customer portal are independent of the email address used to register the 'Trial' and to log in to {CE}.
So if you have not received the email with the activation key, please contact the person in your organization who purchased the subscription.
====

The activation key can also be viewed in the {CMK} customer portal.
The steps in this procedure are described in detail in the link:https://checkmk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/271810567/[{CMK} Knowledge Base^].


[#license_activate]
=== Activating a license

Once you have received the activation key by email or copied it from the {CMK} customer portal, enter the key in the {CE} web interface. 
Click [.guihint]#Activate license,# to open the following dialog box:

image::admin_panel_dialog_activate_license.png[alt=“Dialog box for entering the activation key.”, width=88%]

Note the warning that the trial site will be deleted, enter the key and confirm.
Following a successful activation, the license management page will look something like this:

.The license management page in a licensed status
image::admin_panel_licensing_licensed.png[alt=“Admin panel with the license management page in a licensed status.”,width=84%]


[#subskription_manage]
=== Managing subscriptions

For a licensed subscription you can call up the {CMK} customer portal with the [.guihint]#Manage your subscription# button and there you can also update your subscription.


[#status_page]
== Viewing the status page

You can open the status page with the [.guihint]#Status page# entry in the [.guihint]#Help# menu of the navigation bar in the Admin Panel and also in the {CMK} interface.
In addition to general information on availability, the regular maintenance times for {CE} are also published on this page.
