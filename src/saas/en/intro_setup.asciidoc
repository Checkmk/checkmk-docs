This article describes how to register for the 30-day test period ('Trial') in order to test {CE} during this period without obligation.

[TIP]
====
Note that the trial has the following restrictions, among others:
A maximum of 2500 xref:glossar#service[services] can be monitored.
If you _do not_ license {CE} during the 30-day trial period, the {CMK} xref:glossar#site[site] will be automatically deleted after the trial period expires.
====


[#signup_trial]
== Registration

The procedure to begin a trial of {CE} is straightforward, and only requires you to enter an email address, a password, and then receive the verification code sent to you by email.
To get started, open the link:https://checkmk.com/product/checkmk-cloud-saas[{CE} product page^] on the {CMK} website and click on [.guihint]#Start free trial#
-- or take the shortcut via link:https://admin.checkmk.cloud/[https://admin.checkmk.cloud/^].

image::intro_signup_trial_saas.png[alt=“Dialog box to register for the {CE} trial.”,width=74%]

Enter your business email address in the registration dialog box shown above.
This email address will be your username that you will later use to log in to {CE}.

Note and read the linked documents and then click [.guihint]#Start free trial.#

image::intro_password_saas.png[alt=“Dialog box for entering the password for the e-mail address.”,width=74%]

In the above dialog box you are asked to enter a password.
{CE} checks how strong the password is and -- by asking link:https://haveibeenpwned.com/[Have I Been Pwned^] in the background -- whether the password has already been compromised.
You will receive feedback below the input field.

Continue by clicking on [.guihint]#Next: Verify account#.
You will then receive an email from `no-reply@mail.checkmk.cloud` with the subject `Checkmk Cloud: Verify your account` and a 6-digit verification code as content.
Enter this code in the following dialog box and send it:

image::intro_verificationcode_saas.png[alt=“Dialog box for entering the verification code.”,width=74%]

If everything is correct, you will receive a confirmation message:

image::intro_continue_to_login_saas.png[alt=“Dialog box to change to login.”,width=74%]

With [.guihint]#Continue to login# you can then proceed to the initial login.


[#login_first]
== The first login

image::intro_login_saas.png[alt=“Login dialog box.”,width=74%]

Log in to this dialog box with the login data you provided during registration.

In the next two dialog boxes, you will be asked for some basic information.
These are used to get to know you better and to determine the name for the first {CMK} xref:glossar#site[site] that will be automatically created for you later.
These two dialogs are only displayed following the very first login:

image::intro_create_site_saas.png[alt=“Dialog box for entering the site name.”,width=72%]

Enter the name of your organization and the name of the site to be created -- in the example, this is called ‘mysite’.
The organization name cannot be changed later.
This will be used in {CE} as the _tenant_ name and you will encounter it again later in the {CE} web interface.

Next, select the time zone, and finally the region in which the site is to be hosted, e.g. the EU or the USA.
This region selection also cannot be changed later.
The site's own data is saved in the selected region.
Note that the actual {CE} administration data -- i.e. the data created with the xref:admin_panel[admin panel] -- is always saved in the EU.

You can enter additional information in the following dialog:

image::intro_additional_info_saas.png[alt=“Dialog box for entering additional information.”,width=72%]

Click on [.guihint]#Create {CMK} site# to finish the preparation dialogs and start the creation of the site.
This process can take a few minutes, during which {CE} will keep you up to date on the individual steps up to and including completion:

image::intro_message_creating_site_saas.png[alt=“Message while the site creation is running.”,width=74%]

The short wait will soon be over and you will next see the {CE} user interface (GUI):

image::intro_welcome_saas.png[alt="The {CE} user interface with the topic in the onboarding guide for creating the first host."]

At this point the actual user interface will only be visible dimmed in the background.
In the foreground you will see a topic in the _onboarding guide_, which will be explained in more detail in the next section.
This topic provides instructions for how you can add your first xref:glossar#host[host] to the monitoring of {CE} in just a few steps.
Using {CMK} without hosts is only moderately exciting, because without something to monitor, you cannot really see what {CMK} can do.

You should now take advantage of the opportunity to add your first host to the monitoring by following the instructions in the onboarding guide.
In this guide for beginners, however, we will first introduce some important components of the user interface.
We will then come back to the creation of that first host in the xref:intro_setup_monitor#[chapter after the next].
We promise.

Use [.guihint]#Close# to close the modal dialog for the onboarding guide and switch to the {CMK} user interface.
If you already know {CMK} from an _on-premises_ edition, the user interface will look very familiar to you.
However, you will find access to two elements that are only available in {CE}: the onboarding guide, which we have just mentioned, and the admin panel.


[#onboarding_guide]
== The onboarding guide

[{image-left}]
image::intro_getting_started_button_saas.png[width=80]

The onboarding guide in {CE} anchors access to helpful information directly in the user interface.
You can open it on any {CMK} page by clicking the green [guihint]#Getting started# button located on the right side of the user interface (and not on the left, as in this User Guide).
The onboarding guide opens by hovering over the GUI from the right-hand side.

This guide contains topics covering the most important configuration tasks in {CMK}, e.g. creating hosts, customizing xref:glossar#service[services] or setting up xref:glossar#notification[notifications].
The topics are written in such a way that you can reach your goal quickly.
They contain specific instructions that you can execute directly in the GUI.
You can often open the corresponding page in {CMK} directly by clicking on a link in the topic without having to navigate through the GUI manually.

The topics in the onboarding guide focus more on the 'the how' and less on the 'the why'.
If you are looking for more detailed and explanatory information, you will find it, as usual with {CMK}, in the {CE} User Guide.

In addition to the topics written exclusively for the tasks in {CE}, the onboarding guide offers a very useful search function in the top line, with which you can quickly search through the most important sources for {CMK} and {CE}: the onboarding guide itself, the {CE} User Guide, the video tutorials and the {CMK} forum.

image::intro_onboarding_guide_saas.png[alt=“The onboarding guide start page.”,width=88%]

[TIP]
====
The topic for creating the first host, which was shown after the xref:login_first[first login], can be brought back to the foreground by clicking on [.guihint]#Add hosts > Command Line Download & Install#.
====

Close the opened onboarding guide by again clicking on the green [.guihint]#Getting started# button.
The context will be retained so that you can continue where you left off when you reopen it.
If the green button obstructs your view of elements of the user interface, you can also (temporarily) hide it.
In the xref:user_interface#user_menu[User menu] you will find the appropriate entry for this.


[#admin_panel]
== The admin panel

[{image-left}]
image::intro_navbar_admin_button_saas.png[width=80]

During the xref:signup_trial[registration] you entered, among other things, your email address, which serves as your username, and the name for the site that was subsequently created automatically.
If you are wondering where these entries ended up in {CE}, the answer is: in the admin panel.

The admin panel is the central point for managing sites, users and licenses in {CE}.
Here you will find all of the configuration options that are specific to {CE}, and which are therefore not accessible in the {CMK} user interface.

You open the admin panel by clicking on [.guihint]#Admin# in the xref:glossar#navigation_bar[navigation bar].

.The {CE} admin panel
image::intro_admin_panel_saas.png[alt=“The admin panel with the overview of the sites.”]

The admin panel also has a navigation bar on the left-hand side.
A click on [.guihint]#Sites# shows the sites set up in {CE}.
Similarly, a click on [.guihint]#User management# displays a table with all users.
The user table currently only contains one user with the name of the email address you entered and the assigned role [.guihint]#Administrator#.

A detailed description of the admin panel functions can be found in the xref:admin_panel#[article of the same name].
One more note at this point:
In the table row for a site, you will find the [.guihint]#Site details# entry in the [.guihint]#More# menu on the far right.
This entry opens a dialog box in which you will find, among other things, the URL with which you can call up the site's {CMK} interface directly -- without having to go through the admin panel.

From the admin panel, switch to the site's {CMK} interface by clicking on the site name (in our example `mysite`).

You should do this now, because xref:intro_gui#[we will now continue with the {CMK} interface].
