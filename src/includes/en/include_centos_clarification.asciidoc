[TIP]
====
CentOS is only supported by {CMK} up to version 8.5.2111.
After this, CentOS changed its release model from _downstream_ to _rolling/upstream_ ("CentOS Stream").
In case you want to use {CMK} on CentOS Stream, you have to setup xref:introduction_docker#[Docker] or a virtual machine (for example running the xref:appliance_install_virt1#[{CMK} appliance]).
