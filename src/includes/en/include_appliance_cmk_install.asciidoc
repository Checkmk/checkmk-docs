=== Basic information	

From appliance version 1.4.14, the {CMK} software is not pre-installed in the appliance.
The reason for this is simple: {CMK} is updated much more frequently than the appliance and of course you should not have to start with an outdated {CMK} version.

The installation of {CMK} in the appliance does not run via the command line as on normal computers, but conveniently via its own web interface -- as you will see in the following.
To be able to use this web interface, you must xref:appliance_usage#network_access[activate] it in the appliance management.

The {CMK} software for installation in the appliance is provided to you as a CMA ({CMK} appliance) file.
This is simply an archive format containing the {CMK} folder structure plus an info file.


=== The {CMK} installation

Download the CMA file from the {CMK} link:https://checkmk.com/download[download page].
You will get the appropriate CMA file after selecting the appropriate {CMK} edition and version, and the appliance platform.

After downloading the CMA file, select [.guihint]#Check_MK versions# from the main menu.
On the following page, use the file selection dialog to find the CMA file on your hard drive and confirm your selection by clicking on [.guihint]#Upload & Install#.

The {CMK} software will now be uploaded to the appliance. 
This may take a few minutes depending on the network connection between it and your computer. 
Once the upload has completed successfully, you will see the new version in the table of installed software versions:

It is possible to install multiple {CMK} versions to run in parallel on a single appliance. 
This allows the operation of several sites in differing versions, and the individual sites can be updated to newer versions independently of each other. 
For example, you can install a new version and first try it out in a test site and then, after a successful test, update your production site.

You load and install additional {CMK} software versions in the same way as the first one.
The result will look like this:

If a particular software version is not being used by a site, you can delete that version by clicking on the recycle bin icon.
