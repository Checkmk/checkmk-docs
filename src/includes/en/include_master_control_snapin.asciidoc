In the [.guihint]#Master control# snap-in on the sidebar, you can switch various monitoring functions off and on again individually, such as the [.guihint]#Notifications#.
This latter is very useful if you are carrying out major modifications to the system and do not want to annoy your colleagues with unnecessary messages.

*Important:* Make sure that all switches are turned on during normal operation, otherwise important monitoring functions may be switched off.
