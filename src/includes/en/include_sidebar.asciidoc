The _sidebar_ is your {CMK} cockpit. 
It is the place where you have a continuous overview of the most important monitoring information, as well as quick access to the functions that you need most frequently in {CMK}.

You can compose the complete sidebar according to your preferences.
The sidebar elements, also called 'snap-ins', serve this purpose.
Snap-ins are compact GUI containers with predefined functions. 
Since the sidebar is intended to hold *your* preferences, by default a new installation contains only a few snap-ins:

* [.guihint]#Overview# -- An overview of all monitored objects with their current status information

* [.guihint]#Bookmarks# -- Your personal bookmarks within {CMK}

* [.guihint]#Master control# -- Various main switches for the monitoring

If you click on icon:button_sidebar_add_snapin[alt="Icon for displaying all snap-ins."] at the very bottom of the sidebar, the main page will show you all the snap-ins that are currently *not* in your sidebar and that you can add with a single click.
In this preview, the lower area of each snap-in shows a short description about its meaning and purpose.
Try it out and fill the sidebar as a test.

Depending on the size of your screen, not all snap-ins may now be visible.
The fastest way to move vertically through the sidebar is to use the mouse wheel while the mouse pointer is over the sidebar. 
On touchpads, this function is often possible with the gesture 'slide two fingers up and down together' method.

In the sidebar you can manipulate the snap-ins like this:

* Expand or collapse: 
Click *in* the displayed title of the snap-in. 
Alternatively, point to the title bar and then click icon:button_show_snapin[alt="Icon for showing the snap-in."] or icon:button_hide_snapin[alt="Icon for hiding the snap-in."].
* Show more or less: 
Some snap-ins (like [.guihint]#Overview#) offer you two views -- either with only the most important information or with all information. 
Point the mouse at the title bar and click icon:button_showmore[alt="Icon for switching to Show more mode."] or icon:button_showless[alt="Icon for switching to Show less mode."] to switch between the two modes.
* Move: 
Press the left mouse button *right next* to the title, drag the snap-in up or down to another position in the sidebar and release the mouse button.
* Remove from sidebar: 
Point the mouse at the title bar and click icon:button_sidebar_close_snapin[alt="Icon for removing the snap-in from the sidebar."].

So much for the options for customizing the sidebar's content. 
As a whole, you can hide and show the sidebar -- with [.guihint]#Sidebar# in the navigation bar -- and you can move its position from right to left so that it docks with the navigation bar -- in the menu [.guihint]#User > Sidebar position#.
