Using the search field in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, you can search the configuration environment of {CMK}, i.e. the [.guihint]#Setup# menu itself, with all of its visible entries and additionally with some hidden ones.

The _search scope_ includes, among other things, all rule sets that are grouped into topics in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu and the [.guihint]#Global settings#.
Searches are carried out in the titles and the parameter names.

You search with free text, i.e. without filter rules as in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu.
You do not need to pay attention to upper and lower case.
The search results are displayed as you type:

ifdef::onprem[]

endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
image::gui_setup_menu_search_saas.png[[alt="Setup menu with search results.", width=65%]
endif::[]
