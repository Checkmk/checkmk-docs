With the _navigation bar_ on the left and the icons it contains, you make the basic decisions about what {CMK} should do for you:

[.guihint]#Monitor# -- The monitoring itself

[.guihint]#Customize# -- For the customization of interface elements useful for the monitoring (such as bookmarks, views, dashboards, and graphs)

[.guihint]#Setup# -- For the setting up of the objects to be monitored (such as hosts and services)

Behind these three symbols are more or less extensive menus, the so-called 'mega menus' or icon menus, whose entries are divided into several topics -- for example, in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu under the [.guihint]#Hosts# topic you will find entries for configuring hosts, host groups, host tags and host-specific rules.

At the bottom of the navigation bar, in the [.guihint]#Help# menu, you will find the edition and version of {CMK} currently in use and some entries with which you can call up documentation and information -- inside {CMK} or outside. 
Among other things, you can also open this User Guide. 
If there are incompatible changes after an xref:update#[update], you will see the number in the [.guihint]#Help# menu icon. 
In the [.guihint]#Help# menu itself, a link in red background color is then displayed with which you can open the list of xref:glossar#werk[Werks] of these incompatible changes.

ifdef::saas[]
At the bottom of the navigation bar, in the [.guihint]#Help# menu, you will find the version of {CE} currently in use and some entries with which you can call up documentation and information -- inside {CMK} or outside. 
Among other things, you can also open this User Guide. 
If there are incompatible changes after an xref:admin_panel#site_update[update] of the site, you will see the number in the [.guihint]#Help# menu icon. 
In the [.guihint]#Help# menu itself, a link in red background color is then displayed with which you can open the list of xref:glossar#werk[Werks] of these incompatible changes. 
endif::[]

The [.guihint]#User# menu contains entries that apply to your user account.
At the top right of the menu you will see the current user name and the xref:wato_user#roles[role] assigned to this user. 
In this menu you can personalize your profile and log out of the {CMK} interface.
An overview of the available personal settings can be found in the xref:user_interface#user_menu[chapter on the User menu].

ifdef::saas[]
The [.guihint]#Admin# button opens the xref:admin_panel#[admin panel] for the administration of {CE} in a new tab.
endif::[]

The navigation bar is completed at the very bottom by [.guihint]#Sidebar# (which allows you to hide or show the sidebar by simply clicking on it) and at the very top by the {CMK} logo. 
Clicking on the logo always takes you back to the default dashboard displayed on the main page.
