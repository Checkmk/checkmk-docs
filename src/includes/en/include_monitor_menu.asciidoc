Your basic toolbox for completing all monitoring tasks is the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, which you can open via the navigation bar:

.The [.guihint]#Monitor# menu of {RE} in Show less mode
image::monitor_menu_less.png[alt="Monitor menu of {RE} in Show less mode."]

In this menu you will find the tools that will provide you with answers to your monitoring questions. 
The menu is subdivided according to _topics_.
You will find the menu items listed below each topic.

After selecting one of the entries in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, the requested information is usually displayed on the main page either as a dashboard or as a view -- each of which we will cover in more detail in this article.

[TIP]
====
You can also load the contents of the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu into the sidebar -- as a snap-in with the title [.guihint]#Views#. 
This snap-in is not included in the sidebar by default. 
But you can simply add it to the sidebar by clicking icon:button_sidebar_add_snapin[alt="Icon for displaying all snap-ins."] from the list of available snap-ins.
