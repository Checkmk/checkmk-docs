[#introduction]
== Introduction
link:https://pushover.net/[Pushover^] is a simple service to send messages from various sources to Apple or Android mobile devices, where they appear as notifications. 
On the desktop, the messages can be received via the browser.
The connection is established via two API keys for a group and an app/source.


[#config_pushover]
== Configuring Pushover

In Pushover you need to create both a group, even if you only have one 'group', and an app explicitly for {CMK} -- each receives their own API key:

. Create a new group with at least one member via [.guihint]#Create a Group# in Pushover.
. Copy the displayed Group API key.
. Create an app with any name via [.guihint]#Create an Application/API Token#.
. Copy the displayed App API key.


[#config_checkmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

In {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the two keys copied above:

. Create new parameters for Pushover with [.guihint]#Setup > Events >  Notifications > Parameters for notification methods > Parameters for Pushover > Add parameter.#
. Enter the copied App API key under [.guihint]#API key#.
. Enter the copied Group API key under [.guihint]#User / Group Key#:

You can optionally activate the [.guihint]#Priority# and [.guihint]#Select sound# Pushover functions.
You can use the priority function to override rest periods configured in Pushover -- and then accompany such notifications with appropriate sounds.

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notification_rules#notification_testing[notification rules].
