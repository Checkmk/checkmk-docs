link:https://pushover.net/[Pushover^] is a simple service to send messages from various sources to Apple or Android mobile devices, where they appear as notifications. 
On the desktop, the messages can be received via the browser.
The connection is established via two API keys for a group and an app/source.


[#config_pushover]
== Configuring Pushover

In Pushover you need to create both a group, even if you only have one 'group', and an app explicitly for {CMK} -- each receives their own API key:

. Create a new group with at least one member via [.guihint]#Create a Group# in Pushover.
. Copy the displayed Group API key.
. Create an app with any name via [.guihint]#Create an Application/API Token#.
. Copy the displayed App API key.

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Push Notifications (using Pushover)#.
. Enter the copied App API key under [.guihint]#API Key#.
. Enter the copied Group API key under [.guihint]#User / Group Key#:

You can use the priority function to override rest periods configured in Pushover -- and then accompany such notifications with appropriate sounds.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:
