link:https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie[Opsgenie^], now a part of Atlassian, as an incident management platform provides alerting and escalation for support teams, and can integrate many external tools, including {CMK}.
The basic connection requires only an API key and a URL,
but you can also specify other options in {CMK}, such as additional information depending on the notification's source type.


[#config_opsgenie]
== Configuring Opsgenie

You can find a short guide on how to integrate {CMK} directly within Opsgenie -- but this is based on an older {CMK} version where you had to pass a complete URL including API key.
In current versions, you enter the URL and key separately.
In addition, the URL is only required for accounts hosted in Europe.

. Create a team or call up an existing one.
. Choose the entry {CMK} under [.guihint]#Integrations/Add Integration#.
. In the displayed -- incorrect -- instructions you will find a URL under [.guihint]#Paste#, including options and API key.
Copy the domain part of the URL (`\https://api.eu.opsgenie.com`).
. Next copy the API key and save the integration.

== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

In {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the two data copied above:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Opsgenie#.
. Enter the copied key under [.guihint]#API Key to use#.
. Activate -- as an EU user -- the [.guihint]#Domain# check box, and paste the copied URL there:
+
image::notifications_opsgenie.png[alt="The notification method settings for Opsgenie."]
+
Instead of entering the URL directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

The configuration of the Opsgenie notification method provides you with all kinds of additional options, especially for enriching and changing the default contents of the notifications.
In addition, you can use the [.guihint]#Responsible teams# item to specify the Opsgenie team if you have not specifically integrated for one team as described here, but for the entire Opsgenie account -- which is only possible with certain subscriptions.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:
