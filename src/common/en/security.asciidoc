:title: Security - Additional safeguarding for {CMK}
:description: {CMK} is already very safe by design. This article describes what you can do to make your monitoring even more secure.


This article will be completed in the near future to provide a central overview on all aspects of security measures implemented in {CMK} and aids on further improving security.

First the Good News: Since its beginning {CMK} has used an architecture that considers security needs and -- wherever possible -- applies these to its standard settings.
There are however aspects where user intervention is required, for example when keys or certificates have to be generated or imported.
You can view the certificates that are pre-installed in {CMK} on the [.guihint]#Certificate overview# page in the software.
Further information about this topic is provided in the article xref:certificates#[Certificate overview in {CMK}].


[#agent_output]
== Agent output

{CMK} offers

TLS encryption for communication between the server and the agents on Linux and Windows hosts.
Detailed information on this communication are covered in the following articles:

- xref:agent_linux#[Monitoring Linux]
- xref:agent_windows#[Monitoring Windows]

ifdef::onprem[]
However there are some environments where TLS encryptions for Linux or Unix clients cannot be setup.
In such cases you might use encrypted tunnels, for example with SSH:

- xref:agent_linux_legacy#ssh[Monitoring and securing Linux in legacy mode]
- xref:datasource_programs#[Data source programs]
endif::[]

[#https]
== HTTP(S) communication

On many places within {CMK} communication is realized over HTTP.
This applies to internal communication and configurations such as distributed monitoring.
Switch to HTTPS where possible:

- xref:omd_https#[Securing the web interface with HTTPS]
- xref:ldap#ssl[Securing LDAP with SSL]
- xref:appliance_usage#ssl[Protecting the appliance-GUI via TLS]
- xref:introduction_docker#https[Securing Docker with HTTPS]
endif::[]

ifdef::saas[]
== HTTPS communication/web interface

The web interface of your {CMK} site is protected against intrusion attempts and misuse via AWS WAF v2 (_Amazon Web Services Web Application Firewall v2_).
This affects, among other things:

* Access from IP addresses that are known to be untrustworthy is blocked. The list is managed by AWS and extended by us.
* Access from IP addresses that can be attributed to anonymization services is blocked. This may also affect some VPN providers.
* The number of login attempts per time unit and IP address is limited. If a limit is exceeded, a captcha must be solved.
* We block access from networks that are assigned to countries against which the EU has imposed export sanctions.

ifdef::onprem[]
[#access_control]
== Access control

{CMK} supports connections to various authentication protocols and is also able to enforce two-factor authentication for even higher security:

- xref:ldap#[User management with LDAP/Active Directory]
- xref:wato_user#2fa[Two-factor authentication of {CMK} users]
- xref:kerberos#[Single sign-on with Kerberos]
- xref:saml#[Authentication with SAML]
endif::[]


ifdef::onprem[]
[#logging]
== Logging

The log file `security.log` facilitates the detection of security-relevant events.
Events from the categories of authentication, user administration, services (e.g. the starting and stopping of xref:glossar#site[sites]), and application errors are logged here.
You can find this log file in the site directory, and the following shows some examples of typical log entries:

.~/var/log/security.log
[{file}]

Each line is structured as follows:

* Date and time (local time) when the log entry was created.
* Security domain (e.g. `cmk_security.auth` ) and process ID.
* The message itself as a summary (`summary`) and in detail (`details`), each in JSON format.
The content of the details varies depending on the security domain.

Note that the contents of the log file may change in the future, for example due to the addition of additional security domains, logged events or the information provided in the details.

[#livestatus]
== Livestatus
Access to the xref:livestatus#[Livestatus interface] is provided without explicit authentication.
However, you can restrict access to specific IP addresses, which you can list under [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global Settings > Access to Livestatus via TCP#.

.Access to Livestatus can be restricted via IP whitelist
