== Introduction

{CMK} allows you to comprehensively monitor MySQL and Galera clusters for MySQL.
You can find a complete list of monitoring options in our link:https://checkmk.com/integrations?tags=mysql[Catalog of check plug-ins^].
Among other things, {CMK} can monitor the following:

In order to be able to monitor the databases, besides the {CMK} agent you
only need the agent plug-in on the database server. Additional
software is neither required on the {CMK}, nor on the database server.

Next, we will describe setting up MySQL monitoring for Linux and Windows hosts.
Later we will go into setting up using the xref:monitoring_mysql#bakery[Agent Bakery].


== Setting up the monitoring


[#benutzereinrichten]
=== Creating a user

==== Linux and Windows

The only requirement for setting up monitoring within MySQL is that a
database user and its password must be available. This user only needs reading
rights to the MySQL instances. If such a user does not yet exist, create it in
the instances to be monitored. To do this, log on to MySQL with a user with
sufficient access rights, and then create a new database user:

[{sql}]
----
mysql> CREATE USER 'checkmk'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyPassword';
----

This newly created user needs authorization to read the instances. Therefore,
check whether the user has the necessary permissions, or add them with the
following command. The following example does this for the user `checkmk`:

[{sql}]
----
mysql> GRANT SELECT, SHOW DATABASES ON *.* TO 'checkmk'@'localhost';
----

If you use MySQL replication, the user must at least have the REPLICATION CLIENT
right to monitor the replica server:

[{sql}]
----
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'checkmk'@'localhost';
----


=== Installing the plug-in

==== Linux

ifdef::onprem[]
The required `mk_mysql` plug-in can be found on your {CMK} server via [guihint]#Setup > Linux, Solaris, AIX files > Plugins# or alternatively in the `~/share/check_mk/agents/plugins/` directory.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
The required `mk_mysql` plug-in can be found on your {CMK} server via [guihint]#Setup > Linux, Solaris, AIX files > Plugins#.
endif::[]

As a first step, copy this plug-in into the plug-ins directory for the xref:agent_linux#manualplugins[agent] on the host to be monitored.
The plug-ins directory is usually `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/`.
As soon as the script is in the specified directory, make it executable:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod 700 mk_mysql
----

This plug-in can of course also be run xref:agent_linux#async_plugins[asynchronously] if required.

==== Windows

The Agent for Windows comes with a number of plug-ins as standard.
That is why you will also find the plug-in for monitoring MySQL on your host
after installing the agent. Simply copy this into the correct directory for use.

[{powershell}]
----
PS> copy "c:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service\plugins\mk_mysql.vbs" c:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins\
----


=== Creating the configuration file

The configuration file that you create below - or xref:bakery[via the Agent Bakery] - is used as the only source for the MySQL monitoring settings.
Any other configuration settings that may exist locally are not taken into account by {CMK}.


==== Linux

Then create a file with the name `mysql.cfg` in the
xref:agent_linux#pluginconfig[configuration directory] (regular:
`/etc/check_mk/`) for the {CMK} agent on the target host.

The agent can retrieve the desired information from your MySQL instance using the user data entered in it.
Although the specification of a database user is optional, we recommend this as the agent usually runs the plug-in as the system user `root`.
If no database username is specified, the MySQL client attempts to access the database with the username of the executing system user without using a password, or by using the password stored in `.mylogin.cnf`.
Further information can be found, for example, in the link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.1/en/option-files.html[MySQL documentation^].

This is done in the usual format for MySQL configuration files:

./etc/check_mk/mysql.cfg
[{ini}]
----
[client]
user=checkmk
password=MyPassword
----

Saving the access data with the following command protects against unauthorized access:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod 400 mysql.cfg
----


==== Windows

On a Windows host, create a file named `mysql.ini` in the directory below:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config\mysql.ini
[{ini}]
----
[client]
user=checkmk
password=MyPassword
----

If you run multiple MySQL instances with different usernames and passwords on
the host, simply create one `.ini` file per instance using the following naming
scheme: `mysql_INSTANCE-ID.ini`

=== Creating services

Now that you have installed and configured the plug-in, you can perform a
xref:hosts_setup#services[service discovery] for this host. The following screenshot
shows only a selection of the services that can be found:

image::mysql_discovery.png[]



== Advanced configuration

=== Executing a plug-in asynchronously

The plug-in for monitoring MySQL like so many others can be run
asynchronously, for example to take longer runtimes into account for large
MySQL instances.

==== Linux

On a Linux host, the plug-in is only moved to a subdirectory of the plug-in
directory. For example, if you only want to run the plug-in every 5 minutes,
simply move the `mk_mysql` script to a subdirectory called `300`.
Detailed instructions for the asynchronous execution of plugins can be found in
the xref:agent_linux#async_plugins[article on the Linux agent].

==== Windows

To run the plug-in asynchronously under Windows, adjust the configuration of
the agent, and expand the `execution` section under `plugins`
with the following entry:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{yaml}]
----
plugins:
    execution:
        - pattern: mk_mysql.vbs
          cache_age: 300
          async: yes
----

You can find detailed instructions for the asynchronous execution of plug-ins
on a Windows host in the article on the
xref:agent_windows#customizeexecution[Windows agents].


=== Additional options for the configuration files

==== Setting up communication with MySQL via socket

Instead of letting the agent communicate with MySQL via TCP, you can instruct {CMK} to address the socket.
To do this, simply define the variable `socket` in the `mysql.cfg` file.
Here is an example of the Windows configuration file:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config\mysql.ini
[{ini}]
----
[client]
user=checkmk
password=MyPassword
*socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock*
----


==== Defining hosts manually

Furthermore, it is also possible to set the MySQL host manually via the
configuration files. The corresponding variable is simply called `host`.
Here again using the example of Windows:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config\mysql.ini
[{ini}]
----
[client]
user=checkmk
password=MyPassword
*host=127.0.0.1*
----


=== Configuring thresholds


==== Monitoring sessions


Some of the checks set up in this way have no preset threshold values.
This is usually the case because there are no reasonable default values that
would be sufficient in most cases. However, these can be set up in a few
simple steps. For example, you can find the [.guihint]#MySQL Sessions & Connections#
rule via the familiar [.guihint]#Host & Service Parameters#. This can be used to define
meaningful threshold values for the [.guihint]#MySQL sessions# service that are useful
for your MySQL instance.

image::mysql_sessions_connections.png[]


==== Monitoring connections

We have also not specified any threshold values for the utilization of the
maximum number of simultaneous connections specified by MySQL, since these
depend much more on the structure of your MySQL instance than with other
services. The establishment of corresponding threshold values can be
accomplished in a jiffy with a rule from the [.guihint]#MySQL Connections# set.
The same goes for the amount of open connections.

image::mysql_connections.png[]


==== Monitoring database sizes

The size of individual databases in MySQL is monitored by the link:https://checkmk.com/integrations/mysql_capacity[MySQL: Capacity^] check plug-in.
Threshold values for this plug-in can be determined with the [.guihint]#Size of MySQL databases# rule.

image::mysql_size_database.png[]


=== Monitoring log files

With the help of the link:https://checkmk.com/integrations/logwatch[logwatch^] check plug-in you can also monitor the log files generated by MySQL for errors.
After setting up the plug-in, first check where the corresponding log files are located in your MySQL instance.
Their exact location can be found in your instance's `.ini` or `.cnf` file.

You can enter the logs you are interested in in the logwatch configuration file
and make the following entries for example on a Linux host:

./etc/check_mk/logwatch.cfg
[{file}]
----
/var/log/mysql/error.log
 W Can't create/write to file
 C [ERROR] Can't start server
 C mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /var/run/mysql/mysqld.pid ended
----


[#bakery]
== Configurations using the Agent Bakery

ifdef::onprem[]
{cee-only}
endif::[]
The setup is much simplified with the
xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery], since syntax errors in the
configuration files are avoided, and adaptations to changing environments can
easily be made. The main difference compared to a manual installation is that
only for special MySQL-specific configurations you have to work on the MySQL
host on its command line.

For the initial setup, it is sufficient if you
xref:monitoring_mysql#benutzereinrichten[set up the database user on the MySQL host],
and create a corresponding rule in the bakery. You can find the rule set
under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules#.
You can then search for `MySQL` in the search field:

[{image-border}]
image::mysql_bakery_ruleset_search.png[]

Enter the user ID and password for the new database user. With the following
field you can set the {CMK} agent for Linux hosts so that it does not establish
the connection to MySQL via TCP, but instead via the socket. Depending on the
size and utilization, this can contribute to better performance.

An asynchronous version of the MySQL plug-in can also be defined using this
rule set. This can be useful to take longer runtimes into account with large
MySQL instances, or if the status data is simply not required every minute.

== Diagnostic options


If, for example, unexpected behavior or problems arise when setting up the
monitoring, it is recommended to check directly on an affected host. Since
the plug-ins for monitoring MySQL for both Linux and Windows are shell or
Visual Basic scripts, they can easily be executed without the agent. Regardless
of the operating system used, only the relevant configuration directory needs
to be made known to the shell or to the command line.


=== Diagnostic options under Linux


First check the applicable directories for your respective host.

[{shell}]
----
{c-user}  grep 'export MK' /usr/bin/check_mk_agent
export MK_LIBDIR='/usr/lib/check_mk_agent'
export MK_CONFDIR='/etc/check_mk'
----

Now use the export command to create the `MK_CONFDIR` and
`MK_LIBDIR` environment variables. Customize the commands according to
your actual directories.

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} export MK_CONFDIR="/etc/check_mk/"
{c-root} export MK_LIBDIR="/usr/lib/check_mk_agent"
----

*Important:* These environment variables only exist in the currently open
shell, and disappear as soon as you close them.

You can then run the `mk_mysql` script directly in the of the {CMK}
agent's plug-in directory.

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} pass:[$]MK_LIBDIR/plugins/mk_mysql
----

If all rights have been granted to the database user correctly, you should now
see several hundred lines of output even in a small and fresh MySQL environment.


=== Diagnostic options under Windows

In order to be able to run the Check plug-in on a Windows host manually, first
open a command line with admin rights. Now set the `MK_CONFDIR`
environment variable in this command line  this is required so that the
plug-in can find your configuration files.

[{powershell}]
----
PS> set MK_CONFDIR=c:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config
----

*Important:* Here too an environment variable set here is not permanent,
but only exists for as long as this command line is open.

During the actual execution of the plug-in, it is advisable to redirect the output to the command line.
Windows provides the on-board tool `cscript` for this purpose.

[{powershell}]
----
PS> cscript c:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins\mk_mysql.vbs
----


=== Possible errors and error messages


==== mysqladmin: connect to server at _xyz_ failed

The error message `connect to server at xyz failed` indicates that the
user specified in the configuration file has no access to MySQL. First check
that no transmission errors have crept in when creating the configuration file
(`mysql.cfg` or `mysql.ini`).

If the username or password specified in the configuration file is incorrect,
you will receive something like the following error message:

[{shell}]
----
Access denied for user checkmk
----


==== Database size is not output

If you see a whole series of data from your MySQL instance in {CMK}, but there
is no service that monitors the size of the databases it contains, this is an
indication that the database user does not have the SELECT right.

Check your database user in MySQL with the following command:

[{sql}]
----
mysql> show grants for 'checkmk'@'localhost';
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for checkmk@localhost                                             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, SHOW DATABASES ON *.* TO `checkmk`@`localhost`             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----


If the keyword SELECT is missing in your output, grant the database user the
appropriate rights as specified in the
xref:monitoring_mysql#benutzereinrichten[user setup] chapter.
