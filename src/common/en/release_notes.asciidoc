[#os]
== Server OS

{CMK} can be installed on the following Linux server operating system distributions and versions, that run on x86_64 hardware.
To get a rough estimate of the hardware requirements, please visit link:https://checkmk.com/product/checkmk-system-requirements[the similarly named page within the {CMK} website^].
In this article you will find a complete list of supported operating systems and their versions.
Entries may contain the following additions:

* _Deprecated:_ LTS/LTSS versions marked in this way are still supported for the entire life cycle of version {current-major}. Support will be ceased afterwards.
* _Once released:_ Support for these versions is planned. {CMK} {current-major} packages will be made available shortly after the release of the new distribution version.

We will additionally evaluate any new versions of these distributions as a part of our ongoing support process.
These will be covered in the xref:update_matrix#[update matrix].
