[#basics]
== The basics of file monitoring

With {CMK} you can monitor files for number, size and age, individually or in groups.
This function can be used in many different ways, such as monitoring the success of backup strategies for example:
Are any of the backups older than X days? Is one of the backups suspiciously large or small?
You can also check company-wide file servers to see if users are misusing them as private storage for movies, or keep an eye on classic swap files or volatile files like containers.

The basic procedure is in accordance with the {CMK} standard:
A plug-in/configuration is installed in the agent which brings the desired information on files or file groups into the monitoring.
There, corresponding rule sets are used to determine which properties lead to which statuses.

The actual filtering, i.e. determining which data actually ends up in the monitoring, takes place in the agent.
You can use globbing patterns to recursively include files from entire directories, for example, or only certain file types or even individual files.
Using globbing patterns such as `/myfiles/\*.*`, you may end up with enormously large file lists, even though you may only be interested in particularly old or large files.
Due to this fact, there are currently two agent and associated monitoring rule sets:
The older _fileinfo_ is already built into the agent and filters only by globbing pattern/path, the newer _mk_filestats_ must be installed separately as a plug-in and filters by other properties.

There are other differences between mk_filestats and fileinfo, which we will explain below.
The most important difference, however, is that mk_filestats can only monitor Linux hosts, while fileinfo can also monitor Windows hosts.
For Linux hosts, you should usually use the more up-to-date mk_filestats.


[#differences]
== The differences between mk_filestats and fileinfo
If you want to see the rule sets for the two variants side by side for the sake of clarity, simply type `size age` in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu.
The rules for individual files and groups are named (largely) identically, but the mk_filestats rules are explicitly identified as such.
Both variants of service rules are additionally available as xref:wato_services.html#enforced_services[enforced services.]

.fileinfo rules are not explicitly marked as such
image::filestats_setup_menu.png[alt="Setup menu with mk_filestats and fileinfo entries."]

Differences between the two variants exist at the agent and service levels.
To begin with, here are the basic theoretical differences.
You will find specific details later in the instructions for the mk_filestats agent plug-in as well as for the agent's fileinfo.

In the case of the agent, mk_filestats is distinguished by two options that fileinfo lacks:
Firstly, mk_filestats offers the additional filtering options already mentioned, namely by file size, number and name, the latter in the form xref:regexes#[regular expressions].
For example, with a `/myfiles/*` globbing pattern, you could bring only those files into monitoring that are larger than 1 KB and contain `backup` somewhere in the filename.
On the other hand, with mk_filestats, file groups are also specified directly in the plug-in configuration, simply by creating multiple filters, each of which then ends up as its own xref:wato_monitoringagents#diagnostics[section] in the agent output and which can later be addressed by rules via the section header.

For *service monitoring rules*, the approaches used by mk_filestats and fileinfo differ more in their details.
Both can restrict evaluations to specific xref:timeperiods#[time periods], but only fileinfo allows explicit specification of time windows per day directly in the rule.
Also exclusively, fileinfo can configure so-called [.guihint]#conjunctions# for file groups.
This associates a set of conditions for each status, so for example:
"The status goes to {CRIT} as soon as the oldest file in the group is exactly 5 hours old *and* the smallest file is exactly 8 megabytes."
In turn, for file groups, mk_filestats provides the option to define outliers:
Suppose a file group is supposed to go to {CRIT} as soon as the group size exceeds 2 gigabytes.
However, if the group should *not* go to {CRIT} when a certain single file alone exceeds 1 gigabyte (such as a temporary file), you can define this as a special case, overriding the group rule on a case-by-case basis.

An overview of the differences:

[cols="20,40,40",options="header"]

|===

In the following chapters you will see the two functions individually in practical examples -- the differences and features described should then become clearer.
mk_filestats itself also provides detailed information via the call `filestats.py --help`.


[#mk_filestats]
== Monitoring files with mk_filestats (Linux)

The following example shows the procedure for groups of files.
For individual files the procedure is identical, there are simply fewer options.
Suppose you want to monitor a *group* of a certain number of backup files (`mybackup_01.zip` etc.) and these files should not fall below a minimum size, then you can proceed as follows:


[#mk_filestats_agent_rule]
=== Configuring the rule for the agent plug-in

==== Configuration via the Agent Bakery

ifdef::onprem[]
{cee-only}
In the commercial editions, first
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
First
endif::[]
call the rule for the agent plug-in [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules > Count, size and age of files - mk_filestats (Linux)#.
Under [.guihint]#Section name# you assign an arbitrary name, which appears later in the agent output as an independent section.

Under [.guihint]#Globbing pattern for input files# you then specify which files are to be monitored.
You can use globbing patterns, i.e. ultimately file path specifications with placeholders.
At this point, we want to use an absolute path specification that includes all files in the specified folder.

Further filtering is done by the next two options: [.guihint]#Filter files by matching regular expression# includes files according to a specified template, in this example files with `my` somewhere in their names, and
[.guihint]#Filter files by not matching regular expression# which then excludes files, here those ending in `tmp`.

.Pay attention to the distinction between globs and regular expressions.
image::filestats_agent_rule.png[alt="Form to configure the agent plug-in mk_filestats."]

This completes the configuration and you can distribute the plug-in including its configuration via the xref:agent_linux#install_plugins_using_bakery[Agent Bakery].


==== Manual configuration

ifdef::onprem[]
{cre-only}
In {CRE} you configure the plug-in as usual using a text file:
as the site user you can find an sample configuration in the `share/check_mk/agents/cfg_examples/filestats.cfg` file.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
In case you prefer manual configuration, you can configure the plug-in as usual using a text file:
a sample configuration file `filestats.cfg` is available in the {CMK} GUI under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX  > Related# in the box [.guihint]#Example configurations#.
endif::[]
A configuration according to the above specifications then looks like this:

./etc/check_mk/filestats.cfg
[{file}]
----
[myfiles]
input_patterns: /media/evo/myfiles/
filter_regex: .*my.*
filter_regex_inverse: tmp$
----

This completes the configuration and you can install the agent plug-in xref:agent_linux#manualplugins[manually].


==== Data in the agent output

You will then find the result from your configuration in the form of raw data in the agent output:

.mysite-myhost-agent.txt
[{file}]
----
<<<filestats:sep(0)>>>
[[[file_stats myfiles]]]
{'type': 'file', 'path': '/media/evo/myfiles/mybackup_01.zip', 'stat_status': 'ok', 'size': 13146562, 'age': 339080, 'mtime': 1633966263}
{'type': 'file', 'path': '/media/evo/myfiles/mybackup_02.zip', 'stat_status': 'ok', 'size': 13145766, 'age': 325141, 'mtime': 1633980202}
{'type': 'file', 'path': '/media/evo/myfiles/mybackup_03.zip', 'stat_status': 'ok', 'size': 13151050, 'age': 325352, 'mtime': 1633979991}
...
----

[#mk_filestats_service_rule]
=== Service rule configuration

The monitoring now has access to the file data via the agent.
For evaluation, call the rule [.guihint]#Setup > Services > Service monitoring rules > Size, age and count of file groups (mk_filestats)#.
In our example, we want to be warned as soon as a specified number of files is exceeded or not reached.
This is done by the options [.guihint]#Minimal file count# and [.guihint]#Maximal file count#, which are used to set upper and lower limits. All other minimum-maximum options work analogously.

.Part 1/3: {OK} are here exclusively 7 or 8 files
image::filestats_service_rule_group_value_1.png[alt="Form with upper and lower limits for file monitoring."]

But which file then generates, for example, a {CRIT} status?
The option [.guihint]#Show files in service details# helps here:
If this is enabled, you will see all affected files listed in the service details view.

[#showfiles]
.Part 2/3: This option provides transparency -- but can also produce very long lists
image::filestats_service_rule_group_value_2.png[alt="Specifying to show individual files in service details."]

Now it could be that the correct number of files is present, but there are also outliers with respect to their sizes, for example.
For such exceptions you can use the option [.guihint]#Additional rules for outliers#:
This specifies, for example, that for files below 5 megabytes the status {WARN} is set, below 1 megabyte the service goes to {CRIT}.
This can be useful for being notified of possibly defective backups for instance.

.Part 3/3: files must be at least 5 MB, otherwise a warning will be issued
image::filestats_service_rule_group_value_3.png[alt="Specifying outliers in the monitored files."]

In the [.guihint]#Conditions# box, you can now specify that the rule should apply exclusively to the `myfiles` file group configured in the agent plug-in:
To do this, enter the name you assigned in the agent plug-in under [.guihint]#Section name# as [.guihint]#File Group Name#.

.[.guihint]#File Group Name# corresponds to [.guihint]#Section Name# in the plug-in rule
image::filestats_service_rule_group_condition.png[alt="Filter on files in the myfiles group."]

This also completes the service rule.
You could also optionally limit the evaluation to a single xref:timeperiods#[time period].
Once completed add the new service to the affected hosts and activate the changes as usual.


[#mk_filestats_monitoring]
=== mk_filestats in monitoring

You can then see the evaluation from the monitoring in lists and, of course, in the details.
In addition to the parameters for the service, you will now also be able to see the files that are responsible for the {WARN} or {CRIT} status.

.The files responsible for the status are revealed by mk_filestats in the monitoring
image::filestats_service_monitoring.png[alt="Service details in monitoring for the WARN status."]

However, caution is advised with the xref:showfiles[Show files in service details] option:
If many files have been responsible for a status change, they will all be listed, which can lead to long lists and associated performance and view issues.

.Imprecise regular expressions can produce huge lists
image::filestats_many_files.png[alt="Service details in monitoring for CRIT status."]


[#fileinfo]
== Monitoring files with fileinfo (Linux, Windows)

Monitoring files with fileinfo is basically the same as with mk_filestats, so the procedure here is a bit shortened, but is once again for file groups.


[#fileinfo_agent_rule]
=== Configuring the rule for the agent

==== Agent Bakery configuration

ifdef::onprem[]
{cee-only}
The configuration of the agent in the commercial editions under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules > Count, size and age of files (Linux, Windows)# is much simpler:
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
The configuration of the agent using the Agent Bakery via [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules > Count, size and age of files (Linux, Windows)# is much simpler:
endif::[]
Here you only define the file path in the form of a globbing template.
This also raises the problem of transferring extremely long file lists, which can noticeably slow down monitoring. In addition, a separate service is created by default for each file found, which can only be avoided by forming groups.

.Monitoring all files in this exact directory
image::filestats_fileinfo_agent_rule.png[alt="Rule for fileinfo with filtering on the Windows path."]

*Include all subdirectories:*
On Windows hosts only, you can use the so-called globstar (two consecutive asterisks) to include all files in *all* subdirectories.
However, use this option with caution.
A careless `C:\**` leads either to a 6-digit number of services or a timeout during discovery.

.Monitoring all files in this directory and all its subdirectories
image::filestats_fileinfo_agent_rule_globstar.png[alt="Rule for fileinfo with filtering on the Windows path and all subdirectories."]

*Additional date:*
On Linux hosts you have the possibility to filter by date:
In the globbing pattern, you can use the `$DATE` variable to include only files whose names contain the current date.
The format of this variable is the same as that for the Linux program `date`.

.Under Linux, files with timestamps in their names can only be addressed explicitly
image::filestats_fileinfo_date_rule.png[alt="Rule for fileinfo with filtering by date variable."]

A specification like `/backups/mybackup_*_$DATE:%Y%m%d$` would -- as of today, 10/22/2021 -- consequently find files such as `mybackup_01_20211022` and `mybackup_foobar_20211022`:

.For backup files, timestamps and a daily check are useful
image::filestats_fileinfo_date_monitoring.png[alt="File in the monitoring, filtered by the date in the file name."]

More information can be found directly on the rule's page as well as in the related inline help.

This completes the configuration and you can deploy the plug-in including its configuration via the xref:agent_deployment#[Agent Bakery].

[#fileinfo_manual_configuration]
==== Manual configuration

ifdef::onprem[]
{cre-only}
In {CRE} with fileinfo you must also configure using files, which vary according to the operating system:
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
Of course, you can also configure fileinfo using files, which vary according to the operating system:
endif::[]

*Linux:* the configuration file is `fileinfo.cfg`:

./etc/check_mk/fileinfo.cfg
[{file}]
----
C:\myfiles\*
/myfiles/*
/media/evo/test_$DATE:%Y%m%d$
----

*Windows:* the configuration file is `check_mk.user.yml`:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{yaml}]
----
fileinfo:
  enabled: yes
  path:
  - c:\myfiles\*
  - c:\myotherfiles\**
----

This completes the configuration and you can manually install the plug-in on xref:agent_linux#manualplugins[Linux] or on xref:agent_windows#manual_installation_of_plugins[Windows].


==== Data in the agent output

You will then find the result from your configuration in the form of raw data in the agent output, starting with the section header [.guihint]#fileinfo:#

.mysite-mywindowshost-agent_output.txt
[{file}]
----
<<<fileinfo:sep(124)>>>
1743070736
C:\myfiles\myfile01|30219|1724242936
C:\myfiles\myfile02|30219|1724242936
C:\myfiles\myfile03|1337|1741368907
C:\myotherfiles\myotherfile01|1900|1743070353
C:\myotherfiles\myotherfile02|728|1743070370
C:\myotherfiles\myotherfile03|1023120|1743070389
C:\myotherfiles\mysubdirectory\myfileinasubdirectory|14114|1743070321
----

This is a sample output that could correspond to the xref:#fileinfo_manual_configuration[configuration file] for a Windows host given above.


[#fileinfo_service_rule]
=== Service rule configuration

In the second step, the service rule [.guihint]#Setup > Services > Service monitoring rules > Size, age and count of file groups# is configured again.
The minimum-maximum options correspond to those of mk_filestats, but the options for displaying the affected file names in the service details and for outliers are not present here.
There are two additional options for this:
First, you can directly enter a time period via [.guihint]#Add time range# -- outside this time period the service will always have an {OK} status.

On the other hand, the powerful [.guihint]#Level conjunctions# feature is available:
This allows you to set series of conditions for each of the four states {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT}, and {UNKNOWN}.
For example, you could specify that the service goes to {CRIT} if...

- there are exactly 7 files
- the smallest file is less than 10 megabytes,
- the oldest file is less than 5 days old

.[.guihint]#Level conjunctions# also allow the definition of explicit exceptions
image::filestats_fileinfo_service_rule.png[alt="Specifying conditions for files monitored with fileinfo."]

And again, you can restrict this rule to the desired `myfiles` group with [.guihint]#File Group Name# in the [.guihint]#Conditions# box.

In contrast to mk_filestats, the group formation only takes place in monitoring via the service rule [.guihint]#Setup > Services > Service monitoring rules > File Grouping Patterns#.
You ensure the assignment by also entering the group `myfiles` under [.guihint]#Name of group#.

The patterns for files to be included and excluded are not specified here *by default* via regular expressions, but only via globbing.
However, if you prepend a tilde (`~`), you can also use regular expressions here.

.Input fields do not always behave identically -- the inline help always provides further details
image::filestats_fileinfo_grouping_pattern.png[alt="Filtering of files in the group myfiles."]

*Additional date:* Again the use of the `$DATE` variable is possible. As an alternative you can also use `$YESTERDAY` for filtering, which simply subtracts one day from `$DATE`.
As always, you can get more info on this in the inline help.


[#fileinfo_monitoring]
=== fileinfo in monitoring

In monitoring, the view of a fileinfo group is not very different from an mk_filestats group.
However, fileinfo always lists all affected files explicitly, regardless of whether they are responsible for a status change or not.
Here in the example you can see the two files `yourfile` with 0 megabytes which has no effect on the status, and `yourfile_2.exe` with its almost 11 megabytes which thus triggers the {CRIT} status:

.`yourfile` is displayed by fileinfo, although it is not responsible for the status change
image::filestats_fileinfo_service_monitoring.png[alt="A fileinfo group in monitoring."]

All files delivered to the monitoring by fileinfo and which are not assigned to a group remain as individual services:

.With fileinfo, imprecise globbing patterns can produce huge lists
image::filestats_fileinfo__service_monitoring_singlefiles.png[alt="Single files as separate services in monitoring."]

This very list shows why it is so important to be precise about filters in fileinfo:
For example, if `C:\` were specified here without any restrictions, there would subsequently be several hundred thousand individual services in the monitoring.


[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

=== No files or too many files in the monitoring

No matter whether you work with mk_filestats or fileinfo, missing files or even too many entries in the monitoring are often due to incorrect filters.
There are two main causes of this -- a conflict between a globbing pattern and a regular expression, or an incorrect configuration.
For example, the asterisk behaves differently in the two variants:
In globbing, `\*` stands as a placeholder for any number of arbitrary characters, and in a regular expression, it stands for one or more occurrences of the character preceding it. In order to match any characters in any quantity via regex, you would have to work with `.*` accordingly.
