== What are reports?

{cee-only}
A report in {CMK} is intended to provide an overview of the data, content, and state in {CMK} in a printable form.
It is a compilation of various elements (xref:glossar#view[views], xref:availability#[availability tables], xref:graphing#[graphs], body text, logos) into a printable PDF document.

image::reporting_report.png[alt="Example of a report.", width=70%]

Reports in {CMK} are easy to use:

* No external tools such as Jasper, DB or similar are needed.
* The PDF file is cleanly created, including vector graphics.
* Reports can be managed using templates and inheritance.
* Use the xref:reporting#scheduler[report scheduler] to define reports to be sent periodically.
* Instant reports can be generated via [.guihint]#Export > This view as PDF#.

.Views can be exported as PDF documents at any time
image::reporting_menu_export.png[alt="Expanded 'Export' menu with the entry for PDF creation."]

 
[#builtin]
==  {CMK}'s built-in reports

The {CMK} commercial editions provide some built-in reports as standard.
You can either use these as predefined to get reports from {CMK}, or use them as templates for customizing xref:create_reports[own reports] as required.

Just like xref:glossar#view[views] and xref:glossar#dashboard[dashboards], reports supplied in {CMK} cannot be modified.
But you can clone/copy any existing reports as many times as you like, then modify each to suit your needs.
The procedure for creating xref:create_reports[simple] as well as xref:complex_reports[complex] reports is described below.

An overview of all reports in {CMK}, built-in and custom, can be found at [.guihint]#Customize > Business reporting > Reports# (you may need to click [.guihint]#show more# first):

.Some of the built-in reports
image::reporting_list.png[alt="List of reports."]

On the left side at each line, the following icons are available for the editing functions:

[cols="5,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_clone[alt="Icon for copying a report."] |Clone report
|icon:icon_pdf[alt="Icon for creating a report preview."] |View preview
|icon:icon_reportscheduler[alt="Icon for opening the report scheduler."] |Open xref:scheduler[report scheduler]
|===


== Launching reports

Reports can be launched from various points in {CMK}, depending on their context and purpose.
For example, the appropriate reports can be called from the xref:glossar#navigation_bar[navigation bar] in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu. 

image::reporting_main_menu.png[alt="Selecting reports from the navigation bar."]

Contextually, you can find the reports in the [.guihint]#Export# menu of the various views:

image::reporting_exportmenu.png[alt="List of reports in Export menu."]

In the xref:glossar#sidebar[sidebar] the [.guihint]#Reporting# snap-in gives you quick access to all reports 
that have been designated for display in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu and sidebar, as well as the xref:scheduler[report scheduler]:

.The [.guihint]#Reporting# snap-in can be added to the sidebar
image::reporting_sidebar.png[alt="'Reporting' snap-in in the sidebar.",width=45%]

There are three buttons in this snap-in:

[cols="30,~"]
|===

|[.guihint]#Change Timerange# |Change the time range for instant reports
|[.guihint]#Scheduler# |xref:scheduler[Open the report scheduler]
|[.guihint]#Edit# |Open the list of existing reports
|===


=== Context for reports

There are a number of options for giving reports a context, i.e. to fill them with the data from specific hosts and services.
As a result, reports have to be called in different ways in order to contain meaningful information.
If the context is missing, i.e. specifying which hosts and services should be included in the report, instead of the correct output you will receive only error messages highlighted in red:

image::reporting_output_red.png[alt="Output of a report with unspecified data.", width=79%]

The difference is where the context is specified:

* Context specified (via report properties): The report can be called from anywhere and it will always be filled with the correct information.
* Context not given: Call made via the [.guihint]#Export# menu in the various views, context is provided by the (filtered) view.

image::reporting_output_nored.png[alt="Output of a report with specified data.", width=78%]

Now think again about the [.guihint]#Reporting# snap-in mentioned above:
this takes you directly to the rendered reports without any further preselection / restriction etc. -- so only those reports that have a _built-in_ context actually make sense here.
Reports whose context is only created via (filtered) views can therefore be safely excluded from the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu as well as the snap-in via the [.guihint]#Hide this report in the monitor menu# option.

image::reporting_general_properties_view2.png[alt="Selection to hide the report in the main menu and snap-in."]


[#create_reports]
== Creating a first custom report

Based on the existing reports and report templates, you can create your first custom report relatively quickly and easily.
We will explain how to do this in a moment.
More in-depth information around more complex reports will follow xref:complex_reports[below] in the text.

The fastest way to create a report is to copy an existing report and then customize it.
For example, if you want to create an overview of the availability of services on a specific host, the host named `mycmkserver`, do the following.

First, open the report overview with [.guihint]#Customize > Business reporting > Reports#:

image::reporting_list_selection.png[alt="Selection from the list of reports."]

Clicking icon:icon_clone[alt="Icon for cloning (copying) a report."] (clone) in front of the report [.guihint]#service_availability# will take you to the basic settings for your new report based on the existing report:

image::reporting_general_properties_simple.png[alt="Entering the basic settings of a report."]

Enter the desired texts for [.guihint]#Unique ID# and [.guihint]#Title#.
We won't deal with the other options in this box, as well as the [.guihint]#Report Properties#, until we get to the xref:complex_reports[more complex reports].

For now, it's enough to scroll down to the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# box.
For [.guihint]#Host#, select [.guihint]#Hostname#.
Next click [.guihint]#Add filter#, to select the appropriate host from the list of host names:

image::reporting_filter_host.png[alt="Selecting the appropriate host for the report."]

Click icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] to save your new report and to return to the reports overview page.
In the section [.guihint]#Customized# you can now directly access your new report by clicking on its title:

image::reporting_customized.png[alt="View of custom report."]


=== Editing functions

You can use the following functions to edit your own reports:

[cols="5,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_clone[] |Clone (copy) report
|icon:icon_delete[] |Delete report
|icon:icon_edit[] |Edit report settings
|icon:button_report_element_lo[] |Edit report contents
|icon:icon_pdf[] |Display preview
|icon:icon_reportscheduler[] |Schedule regular report
|===

A description of the various available options follows in the subsequent sections.


=== Creating a new report without a template

Things get a little more complex now if you want to create a completely new report instead of a copy of an existing report.
As an example, below you will create a simple overview of all problematic services on your site, i.e. all services with a {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN} status.
This overview will be titled ‘critical_services‘.

You create a new report on the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# page via [.guihint]#Reports > Add report#.

image::reporting_add_report.png[alt="Open a new report.", width=38%]

In the first step, leave the filter [.guihint]#Select specific object type# on the [.guihint]#No restrictions to specific objects# selection and go directly to the next selection page with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for continuing."] [.guihint]#Continue#.

image::reporting_no_specific_objects.png[alt="Keep selection 'No restriction to specific objects'."]

As with copying an existing report, first specify a [.guihint]#Unique ID# and [.guihint]#Title#:

image::reporting_general_properties2.png[alt="Assigning unique ID and title for the new report."]

In the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# section, under [.guihint]#Service# now select the [.guihint]#Service states#, then with a click on [.guihint]#Add filter# you can set the desired states:

image::reporting_search_filters.png[alt="Selecting service states for the report."]

With icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] [.guihint]#Save & go to list# the new report will be added to the [.guihint]#Customized# section of the reports overview list.

image::reporting_customized2.png[alt="List of reports with the created own report."]

If you now call up this report in joyful anticipation, the result is sobering.
The report page has an initial layout and also a heading, but is otherwise empty.
Not exactly the result to impress your boss with ...

image::reporting_empty_report.png[alt="Empty report."]

So now you need to define the design of the content for the report.
The icon:icon_edit_report[alt="Icon for editing the report content."] will take you to the page for defining the content to be included in the report.
The selection of report elements is done in three stages, each with a click on icon:icon_save[alt="Symbol for proceeding in the process."] [.guihint]#Continue# in between.

Start by clicking [.guihint]#Add content#.
For this example in [.guihint]#Step 1# select the element type [.guihint]#Availability table#.
Set [.guihint]#Step 2# to [.guihint]#All services# and [.guihint]#Step 3# to [.guihint]#No restrictions to specific objects#.
Leave the other options on the following page unchanged for the moment.
Instead, click directly on icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] [.guihint]#Save#.
Now view the preview of your report:

image::reporting_content_output.png[alt="Preview the report with the added content."]

On the left you can see the preview, here for the report of [.guihint]#critical_services#.
To the right, the elements of the report are displayed in a list.
These elements can be icon:icon_edit[] edited, icon:icon_clone[] copied, icon:icon_delete[] deleted and icon:icon_drag[] reordered.

You can now flexibly customize this simple, self-created report with additional elements as required (see below) and call it up at any time, e.g. from the sidebar.


[#complex_reports]
== Building complex reports

In the previous sections you have seen how to create initial reports with little effort, either as a copy of an existing report or completely new.
These are great ways to achieve initial success.
Most of the time, however, it doesn't stop at such simply structured reports.
More complex presentations, a mixture of different content, a custom layout, etc. are the next logical steps.

The many possibilities can best be shown with an example:

image::reporting_complex_report.png[]


=== Defining the basic settings

In almost every step of the report creation there is the possibility to adjust the content to suit your needs.

In the first step, at the start you can set a filter and limit the report to a specific host or data source, 
such as network interfaces, BI aggregations, sensors, and so on:

.Most of the time, however, you will not need the filters at this level
image::reporting_specific_objects.png[alt="List of filters to restrict the report."]

Next, again enter the [.guihint]#Unique ID# and the [.guihint]#Title#.
For the title you can also use the provided xref:macros[macros] (= text modules).
Next, choose a [.guihint]#Icon# with which the report should be visible in the menus.
By setting the [.guihint]#Make this report available for other users# option to the contact group, in the example `check-mk-notify`,
you give the associated group members the ability to independently access the report at any time and get information on their own.

image::reporting_general_properties_complex.png[alt="Setting the more complex basic properties for the report."]

In the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# box, as usual extensive filtering options are available,
from specific hosts to individual Docker containers to values from Oracle monitoring.

image::reporting_context_search_filters.png[alt="Selection for report content."]

For this example, the host selection is limited to one folder and additionally to specified host issues.
This restriction speeds up data retrieval, especially in more complex environments.

With [.guihint]#Save & go to list# you get to the report overview.
The next step is to define the report's content.


=== Defining report content

Using the icon:button_report_element_lo[] you get to the report content:

image::reporting_edit_content.png[alt="Calling report content."]

Open report content editing with [.guihint]#Reports > Add content#.
Use this to add tables, graphs, tables of contents, or text (also via macros or HTTP) to the report, for example.
These contents appear one after the other and thus also determine the final length of the report.

.A list of all content elements can be found at the xref:content_elements[end of this article]
image::reporting_add_content.png[alt="Adding a content element.", width=58%]

In [.guihint]#Step 1#, select the element you want, for this example [.guihint]#Multiple graphs#.
This will give you, depending on your other settings, multiple graphs of the same type arranged one below the other.
For example, you can map a direct comparison between the states of multiple hosts.

image::reporting_step1.png[alt="Selecting multiple graphs."]

Continue with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."] [.guihint]#Continue#.
As the data source for the graphics, for this example, in step 2 select [.guihint]#All services#, i.e. all services running on the hosts:

image::reporting_step2.png[alt="Selecting the data source."]

Continue with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."] [.guihint]#Continue#.
In step 3 you could now limit the volume of data to be displayed.
This option is not needed for the current example.
Again, switch to the next selection with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."] [.guihint]#Continue#.

image::reporting_properties_context.png[alt="Setting various properties."]

For the sample report, under [.guihint]#Graph layout#, in the [.guihint]#Properties# box, specify that you want provide a title for each of the graphs, 
consisting of the graph's title, host name, and service description.
In addition, set the displayed time range to four hours under [.guihint]#Graph time range#.

In the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# box, you limit the report to specified host or service characteristics.
Here you select the [guihint]#CPU utilization# for the [guihint]#Service# in this example.

By clicking icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] [.guihint]#Save# you have completed the first report element.

For the second graph in this exercise, start again with [.guihint]#Reports > Add content# and in [.guihint]#Step 1# select [.guihint]#Metrics graph of a single service#.
Switch to [.guihint]#Step 2# with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."] [.guihint]#Continue# and restrict the search filters to host name and service description:

image::reporting_context_search_filters2.png[alt="Selecting host name and service description."]

By clicking icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] [.guihint]#Save# the second report element will now also be ready.

The third element to be created is an overview of the current alerts.
The procedure remains the same:

. Call [.guihint]#Reports > Add content#
. [.guihint]#Step 1#: Select the [.guihint]#Availability table# element
. [.guihint]#Step 2#: Data source [.guihint]#Alert Statistics#
. [.guihint]#Step 3#: [.guihint]#Restrict to a single host#
. No further options in the following step

With a click on icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] [.guihint]#Save# this report element is also finished.

To make the display clearer, add headings:

Open [.guihint]#Reports > Add content# to edit the report content.
In [.guihint]#Step 1# select [.guihint]#Heading# as element type.
Switch to [.guihint]#Step 2# with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."] [.guihint]#Continue#.
Optionally, specify a hierarchy level for the heading.
Enter the heading at [.guihint]#The text#.

image::reporting_add_heading.png[alt="Entering the heading text."]

Click icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] [.guihint]#Save# to return to the overview.
However, the new heading will now be positioned below the graphics in the list.
So, in the list of content items, use the icon:icon_drag[alt="Icon for moving elements."] icon to drag the heading to the desired position in the list.

image::reporting_content_overview.png[alt="Editing view of the report with red elements."]

*Tip:* In the preview, you may see red lines and error messages instead of real data -- because in these places the report in the editor lacks context,
here, for example, the specification of a host that would only be revealed by calling the report from an appropriate view.
If you want to see a usable preview, simply filter for a specific host in the report settings in the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# area in the meantime.
This makes designing the report much easier.

image::reporting_content_overview2.png[alt="Editing view of the report without red elements."]


[#views]
=== Visual design of a report

There are complementary design elements available for structuring the appearance of the report, such as horizontal line, image, page frame and a single line of text.
You can display these building blocks on all or specific pages in your report.

For the example report, insert a frame around the report.
Again, the definition is done step by step, each continued by clicking icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."].
Start with [.guihint]#Reports > Add page element#.

.A list of all available page elements can be found at the xref:page_elements[end of this article]
image::reporting_step1_fixed.png[alt="Frame selection."]

Since the frame should be visible on all pages, the next step requires no changes:

image::reporting_placement.png[alt="Selection of element placement."]

The new page frame is now displayed in the overview, both in the preview on the left and in the static page elements table on the right.

image::reporting_content_overview3.png[alt="Current overview of the report."]

*Tip:* You can also use the xref:macros[macros] (=text modules) available in {CMK}, for example, to create another footer with page numbers and the name of the report.
To do this, select the page element [.guihint]#One line of text# and in the second step specify the position at the bottom of the page as well as the text including the desired macros: 

image::reporting_footer.png[alt="Setting the footer."]


=== Customizing the layout

Right away reports look more appealing with a higher-quality appearance, for example, with the company logo added.

Open the report settings with [.guihint]#Reports > Edit properties#:

image::reporting_edit_properties.png[alt="Selecting the report settings.", width=62%]

In the second box, you will find the [.guihint]#Report Properties#.
This is where you configure values for font, page format, time and date settings, report layout, and file name for downloads.

.At this point you can specify basic design features
image::reporting_report_properties2.png[alt="Report layout preferences form."]

Copy your company logo to the `~/local/share/check_mk/reporting/images/` directory and save it as `logo_mk.png` file.
From now on this logo will be displayed on all reports.

image::reporting_own_logo.png[alt="View of report header with custom logo.", width=80%]

*Note:* Currently, you customize the existing report template to suit your needs.
Alternatively, you can create a xref:new_template[complete, new report template] according to your company specifications, to reflect the company's corporate design (CI/CD), for example.


==== Inserting an additional image

Images that you want to use as design elements in your reports must have been previously stored in the `~/local/share/check_mk/reporting/images/` directory.

Click the [.guihint]#Add page element# button in the report creation.

image::reporting_add_page_element.png[alt="Call to select image elements.", width=71%]

In the following [.guihint]#Step 1#, select [.guihint]#Embedded image# as type and continue with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."] [.guihint]#Continue#.

.A list of all available page elements can be found at the xref:page_elements[end of this article]
image::reporting_image_add.png[alt="Dialog for selecting an image element."]

The following dialog is used to specify more detailed settings such as position, file name and size.

.Sizes in millimeters for easy print design
image::reporting_image_properties.png[alt="Dialog for image properties."]

When you are done with all settings, save with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving."] [.guihint]#Save#.
After that the report overview will be displayed and will see the image inserted into the report.

image::reporting_own_pic.png[alt="View of report header with custom logo.", width=80%]


[#scheduler]
== Scheduling a report

You can use the report scheduler to have existing reports created and sent automatically.
You can reach the scheduler on the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# page via [.guihint]#Reports > Scheduler#.


=== Sending a report on a regular basis

Open a new schedule using [.guihint]#Scheduled reports > Add schedule#, then select the report and click icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for proceeding."] [.guihint]#Continue#.

In the [.guihint]#General Options# box, you specify basic settings such as title, creation time, reporting period, and so on:

.For example, you can have a weekly report automatically sent to you as a PDF on Friday afternoons
image::reporting_schedule.png[alt="Report scheduler settings."]

Under [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# you will find the usual filter options, depending on the selected report.
Then save the schedule to return to the list of your scheduled reports.

In the list you will also find information about the last time the report was generated/sent, if there was an error, 
when it will be generated/sent the next time and some more information (shown slightly abbreviated here):

.A scheduled report with detailed, here slightly abbreviated, information
image::reporting_schedule_list.png[alt="List of scheduled reports."]

Entries in the list are managed using the five icons at the beginning of an entry:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_edit[] |Edit report settings
|icon:icon_clone[] |Copy report settings
|icon:icon_delete[] |Delete scheduled report
|icon:icon_pdf[] |Create report
|icon:icon_pdfpreview[] |Display preview
|===

*Note:* Reports that have been sent are not stored on the site.


=== Storing a report locally on a regular basis

Instead of sending the report, you can also store it locally.
To do this, select [.guihint]#Action - Store locally#:

image::reporting_general_options_local.png[alt="Parameters for storing a report locally."]

Next specify a file name and optionally a report title.
To be able to build a history of reports -- {CMK} provides various xref:macros[macros] (= text modules) instead of overwriting the previous report version every time the report is newly created.

The overview of all locally stored reports can be accessed in the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# window via the [.guihint]#Reports > Stored reports# menu item:

image::reporting_reports_storedreports.png[alt="Calling stored reports.", width=34%]


[#global_settings]
== Global defaults for reports

Some basic settings for reports can be defined globally, for example to create and manage a corporate design (CI/CD) centrally.
Settings for an individual report then only specify any deviations from the corporate design.
The global settings for reports can be configured via [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > Reporting#.

.Settings such as templates and font sizes can be defined globally
image::reporting_global_settings.png[alt="Global settings for reports."]


[#new_template]
== Creating your own report template

{CMK} provides a built-in, clear report template that you can add to and use as you wish, as described above.
However, especially reports that are passed on to management look even better if they correspond to your own company layout.
For this purpose, there is an option to create your own report template.

By default, the [.guihint]#Default template for all reports# is used for all reports in {CMK}:

image::reporting_list_selection2.png[alt="The standard template in the report list."]

To create your own report template, copy the default template using icon:icon_clone[alt="Icon for copying"].
First, give the new template a [.guihint]#Unique ID# and [.guihint]#Title#.

To mark this report template as such, in the [.guihint]#Report Properties# box check [.guihint]#This is a front matter Template#:

image::reporting_report_properties4.png[alt="Specify as a report template."]

Following the first save, you will find this new template in the custom report templates list:

image::reporting_customized3.png[alt="List of report templates."]

Now you can customize this template according to the above descriptions, just like any other report.
Change the page layout, font, line colors, etc.
Also set the content elements at the same time.
Exclusively for report templates there is also the report element [.guihint]#Table of Contents#:

image::reporting_step1_content.png[alt="Table of Contents selection."]

To create one of your reports now with the new template, change the settings in the report's [.guihint]#Report Properties# one more time.
Set the [.guihint]#Use settings and page layout from# option to the name of your new template:

image::reporting_report_properties3.png[alt="Change the report template."]

Once this template has been saved, future reports will always be based on it.
