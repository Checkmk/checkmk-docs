[#intro]
== Introduction

ifdef::onprem[]

In the commercial editions of {CMK}

In {CE}

you can configure agent packages so that they can be executed on the host by an unprivileged user, i.e. not by `root`.
This feature is initially fully usable for Linux agents, that have been installed as DEB or RPM packages.

The prerequisite for unprivileged execution is that the agent package has been installed within a single directory.
The option to select an installation directory is available for Linux, as well as for Solaris and AIX.

The two related rules define [guihint]#Installation paths for agent files (Linux, UNIX)# and [guihint]#Run agent as non-root user (Linux)# have been deprecated.
It is planned to remove both in {CMK} version {v25}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The current implementation of the xref:agent_deployment#[Agent Updater] as an agent plug-in is not compatible with unprivileged execution.
We are working on necessary changes to the architecture.
In the meantime, use other software deployment solutions.
====

[#bakery]
== Configuring the agent packages

The agent packages are configured in the xref:glossar#agent_bakery[Agent Bakery], which you open via [guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX#.
Click the [guihint]#Agent rules# button.
Under [guihint]#Agent rules > Linux/UNIX agent options# you will find the rule [guihint]#Customize agent package (Linux).#


[#install_dir]
=== Specifying the installation directory

With [guihint]#Directory for Checkmk agent# you can specify the installation directory:

image::agent_single_folder_rule_installation_directory.png[alt="The option to select the installation directory."]

All agent package files are installed in this directory instead of in directories such as `/etc/`, `/usr/lib/` or `/var/lib/`.
For security reasons, _do not_ select _any_ directory in a user's home directory.

For Solaris and AIX you are now finished.
For Linux, you can also specify unprivileged execution.


[#user]
=== Configuring unprivileged execution

Two basic options are available for the Linux agent after selecting [guihint]#Customize user#:

image::agent_single_folder_rule_user.png[alt="The options for selecting unprivileged execution."]

The default values [guihint]#Run agent as root, set agent controller user#, and `cmk-agent` as user specify exactly the behavior that is the default behavior of the xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agent] for Linux, even without configuring this rule,
so that the Agent Controller will be executed under `cmk-agent`, and the agent script under `root`.
What is new, however, is the option of specifying a different user as `cmk-agent`.

The second option is [guihint]#Run agent as non-root, set agent user.#
This specifies that, in addition to the Agent Controller, the agent script will also be executed under the specified user -- i.e. both are unprivileged.

You can also assign numeric IDs to the user ([guihint]#UID#) and group ([guihint]#GID#).
Note the conventions of your Linux distribution and any existing limitations of the file systems used.

The last option determines whether the user selected in this rule should be created if it does not already exist.

[#config_runas]
=== Preparing privileged execution of individual agent plug-ins

For agent plugins, you can use the rule [guihint]#Plug-ins, local checks and MRPE for non-root users# to individually specify the executing users for certain directories.
This allows you to run plugins in certain folders under other unprivileged user IDs or as root.
This rule generates an agent configuration that is installed automatically.
We will describe further configuration on the host below.
// MFS: end proofreading

[#localconfig]
== Configuring unprivileged execution on the host

If you have configured agent packages for unprivileged execution, additional configuration may be required on the Linux host on which the package is installed.

For security reasons, an agent configured for unprivileged execution offers a slightly smaller range of functions than an agent executed with root permissions.
In order to make the missing functionality available, you as the administrator must find methods
that are both effective and compatible with the security guidelines of your organization and the conventions of the Linux distribution used.

[TIP]
====
Note that this chapter provides no single best solution for either the configuration supplied with the agent packages or the configuration carried out on the host.
All possible and sensible solutions must be based on the distributions used, the operational guidelines in your organization, and maintainability.
====

[#sudo]
=== Configuration of `sudo`

We have added a wrapper function for the agent script, which prefixes commands that generally require high-level privileges with link:https://xkcd.com/149/[`sudo`^].
This affects in {CMK} {v24} `mdadm` (for reading the status of various software RAIDs and encrypted drives), as well as `mailq` (for reading the email queue of the postfix MTA).

Example configurations for `sudo` can be found in the xref:install_dir[installation directory of the agent] in the subfolder `default/package/agent/checkmk_agent_sudoers_template`.
You can transfer the required lines to your `/etc/sudoers` or copy the entire file to `/etc/sudoers.d` (not recommended).
Adjust the entries accordingly.
For example, in some cases no superuser permissions are required to read the email queue and the user ID under which the MTA is executed can be used.


[#plugins]
=== Executing agent plugins without root privileges

For the execution of agent plug-ins we recommend ensuring access to the required information via file permissions, group assignments or _access control lists_.
The following list shows possible methods:

* Add the user under whose ID the agent script is executed to a group that can read required data in monitoring.

* Change the access rights or group assignment of device files (e.g. via `udev` rules) so that the unprivileged user can access them.

// MFS: Proofreading needed, massively changed
[#plugins_root]
=== Executing agent plug-ins with root privileges

In case an agent plug-in requires root privileges for execution, the following possibilities are available:

* If appropriate, execute plug-ins using a cronjob and redirect their output to a xref:spool_directory#[spool file]. With longer intervals than one minute between executions, you also cover plug-ins that would require to be asynchronously executed.

* If you have already xref:config_runas[packaged] agent packages using the rule [guihint]#Plug-ins, local checks and MRPE for non-root users#, you must move plugins that need to be executed as root to the configured directories and apply the configuration for `sudo`.

ifdef::onprem[]
[#legacy]
== Legacy deployment

Unprivileged execution is also possible without an Agent Controller or if the installation cannot be carried out via a DEB or RPM package.


[#foldermanual]
=== Installation without a package manager

When using the TGZ packages provided in `.tar.gz` format, you must ensure that permissions are granted correctly after the installation.
Use a sample installation that you have carried out under Linux with package management as a guide.

[TIP]
====
We will gradually add further information to this section.
====

[#noagentctl]
=== Execution without Agent Controller

If the Agent Controller cannot or should not be used, both the unencrypted call via `(x)inetd` or the encrypted call via Secure Shell are possible.
Minor modifications are required compared to the call with root permissions.


[#xinetd]
==== Xinetd

A configuration file for `xinetd` is provided in the installation directory under `default/package/config/xinetd-service-template.cfg`.
In case of a deactivated or incompatible Agent Controller it will be activated.
This file already contains the unprivileged user defined by the agent rule.
If you are using a different Internet super-server (e.g. the OpenBSD `inetd`), create the configuration according to its documentation.
Examples are shown in the xref:agent_linux_legacy#otherinetd[Monitoring Linux in legacy mode] article.


[#ssh]
==== Secure Shell

The call via SSH also corresponds to the procedure described in the xref:agent_linux_legacy#ssh[Monitoring Linux in legacy mode] article.
Only the path to the configuration file `.ssh/authorized_keys` and the user name used must be adapted to the unprivileged user you are using.
