link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in/[Teams^] is Microsoft's chat and video conferencing solution.
In the business variant, you can create channels for your teams and receive notifications from {CMK} in these.
The connection to Teams is made via a webhook.


[#config_teams]
== Configuring Microsoft Teams

In Teams you need to create a workflow for an webhook request:


. Enter the desired channel.
. In the menu bar of this channel, open the three dots menu and select `Workflows`.
. Search for `Post to a channel when a webhook request is received` and open the workflow.
. Next, you need to give this webhook a name.
. Finally, select the chat to which you want to post.
. On the next page you should see the URL of the new webhook. Copy this URL so that you can paste it into {CMK} in the next step.

The description above is somewhat vague.
This is due to the fact, that the actual way you have to click, might differ in your particular version of MS Teams.
Whenever major changes occur, we try to update the information in a timely fashion.

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Microsoft Teams#.
. Enter the copied URL under [.guihint]#Webhook URL#:
