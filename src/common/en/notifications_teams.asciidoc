[#introduction]
== Introduction
link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in/[Teams^] is Microsoft's chat and video conferencing solution.
In the business variant, you can create channels for your teams and receive notifications from {CMK} in these.
The connection to Teams is made via a webhook.
The Teams API has some limitations, find out more link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/teams/send-a-message-in-teams#known-issues-and-limitations[at Microsoft.^]

== Configuring Microsoft Teams

In Teams you need to create a workflow for a webhook request:


. Enter the desired channel.
. In the menu bar of this channel, open the three dots menu and select `Workflows`.
. Search for `Post to a channel when a webhook request is received` and open the workflow.
. Next, you need to give this workflow a name.
. Finally, select the chat to which you want to post.
. On the next page you should see the URL of the new webhook. Copy this URL so that you can paste it into {CMK} in the next step.

The description above is somewhat vague.
This is due to the fact, that the actual way you have to click, might differ in your particular version of MS Teams.
Whenever major changes occur, we try to update the information in a timely fashion.

== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

In {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the URL copied above:

. Create new parameters for Microsoft Teams with [.guihint]#Setup > Events >  Notifications > Parameters for notification methods > Parameters for Microsoft Teams > Add parameter.#
. Enter the copied URL under [.guihint]#Webhook URL#:

+
Instead of entering the URL directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notification_rules#notification_testing[notification rules].
