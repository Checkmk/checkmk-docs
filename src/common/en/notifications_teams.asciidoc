link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in/[Teams^] is Microsoft's chat and video conferencing solution.
In the business variant, you can create channels for your teams and receive notifications from {CMK} in these.
The connection to Teams is made via a webhook.


[#config_teams]
== Configuring Microsoft Teams

In Teams you only need to create an [.guihint]#Incoming Webhook# (*not* a workflow).


. Enter the desired channel.
. In the menu bar of this channel you should see a `+` icon. Click it.
. Look for a way, to add an app here. There might be a button labeled [.guihint]#Get more apps#.
. Search for `Incoming webhook`. You should find an app by the Microsoft Corporation.
. Add the [.guihint]#Incoming Webhook# app to the channel, where you want to receive your notifications.
. Next you have give this webhook a name.
. On the next screen, you should be presented with a URL of the new webhook. Copy it. This is what you have to add in {CMK} in the next step.

The description above is somewhat vague.
This is due to the fact, that the actual way you have to click, might differ in your particular version of MS Teams.
Whenever major changes occur, we try to update the information in a timely fashion.

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Microsoft Teams#.
. Enter the copied URL under [.guihint]#Webhook URL#:

Instead of entering the URL directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:
