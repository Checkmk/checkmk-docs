:description: With special agents, {CMK} queries systems to be monitored via management APIs. This article provides an introduction to the topic.

[#intro]
== Introduction

ifdef::onprem[]
The {CMK} agent cannot be installed on some systems, and SNMP is not -- satisfactorily --available.

ifdef::saas[]
The {CMK} agent cannot be installed on some systems.

Nevertheless, {CMK} can still monitor such a system -- as long as there is an application programming interface (API) with which {CMK} can retrieve the monitoring data.
Such an API is usually based on Telnet, SSH or HTTP/XML.

ifdef::onprem[]
You do not have to worry about querying these APIs yourself, because {CMK} supplies the necessary so-called xref:datasource_programs#[datasource programs] for commonly implemented systems,

for example for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but also for NetApp, VMware ESXi, Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Cisco Meraki and many more. 
These programs generate agent outputs by querying hardware or software via a management API.
They are also known as _special agents_, because they are a _special_ alternative to the normal {CMK} agent.


[#cmk_gui]
== Special agents in the {CMK} interface

Because special agents sometimes require quite complex parameters, we have defined special rule sets in the Setup GUI that allow you to configure them directly.
You can find these rule sets grouped by use cases under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > VM, cloud, container# and [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Other integrations#:

ifdef::onprem[]
.Rule sets under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > VM, cloud, container# in {CE}

== Using special agents

ifdef::onprem[]
The special agents are installed under `~/share/check_mk/agents/special/`.
If you wish to modify such an agent, first copy the file with the same name to `~/local/share/check_mk/agents/special/` and make your changes in that new version.
endif::[]

As an example, let us take the monitoring of _NetApp Filers_.
These do not allow the installation of {CMK} agents.
ifdef::onprem[]
The SNMP interface is slow, flawed and incomplete.
endif::[]
There is however a special HTTP interface which provides access to the NetApp _Ontap_ operating system and all of its monitoring data.

The `agent_netapp_ontap` special agent accesses this interface via a REST API and is set up as a datasource program using the [.guihint]#NetApp via Ontap REST API# rule set.
The data required by the special agent can then be entered into the rule's content.
This is almost always some sort of access data.
With the NetApp special agent there is also an additional check box for the recording of metrics (which here can be quite comprehensive):

image::special_agents_program_netapp.png[alt="Rule for configuring the NetApp special agent."]

It is important that you leave the host set to [.guihint]#API integrations if configured, else {CMK} agent# in the xref:hosts_setup#monitoring_agents[Setup GUI].

There are occasions in which it is desired that both a special agent, as well as the normal agent are to be queried.
An example for this is the monitoring of xref:monitoring_vmware#[VMware ESXi] over the vCenter.
This latter is installed on a (usually virtual) Windows machine, on which reasonably enough a {CMK} agent is also running:

[TIP]
====
The configuration of important special agents is described in separate articles in this User Guide, for example for 
xref:monitoring_aws#[AWS], xref:monitoring_azure#[Microsoft Azure], xref:monitoring_gcp#[GCP], xref:monitoring_kubernetes#[Kubernetes], xref:monitoring_prometheus#[Prometheus], xref:monitoring_vmware#[VMware ESXi] and xref:integrating_datadog#[Datadog].
