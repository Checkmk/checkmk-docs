[#autoregister]
== Auto-registration

ifdef::onprem[]
{cce-only}
endif::[]
Cloud systems such as xref:monitoring_aws#[Amazon Web Services (AWS)], xref:monitoring_azure#[Microsoft Azure] or xref:monitoring_gcp#[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)] independently create and delete 'objects', 
which correspond to the xref:glossar#host[hosts] in {CMK}.
In order for these cloud objects, once they have been created, to be included without delay as hosts in a {CMK} monitoring, a solution without manual intervention is required.

{CMK} provides the answer with its _auto-registration_ feature -- which enables hosts to be created automatically.
ifdef::onprem[]
As automatic host creation is mainly needed for the cloud environments referred to above, auto-registration is only available from {CCE} onwards, i.e. in {CE} and {ME}.
endif::[]

Auto-registration is achieved through communication between the xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agent] and the {CMK} server.
The agents' Agent Controller makes a request for registration to the server's Agent Receiver, transmitting the data required to create the host.
If the Agent Receiver accepts the request, registration is performed and a TLS-encrypted connection is established.
The host is then created, a xref:glossar#service_discovery[service discovery] is performed and the changes are activated,
so that the host will be added to the xref:glossar#monitoring_environment[monitoring environment] -- a completely automatic process.

For this automation to work, appropriate preparation is of course necessary.
Let's start on the {CMK} site, with the creation of a user who has the authorization for auto-registration, a folder in which the hosts are to be created, 
and a rule that allows the Agent Receiver to process registration requests without manual intervention.
ifdef::onprem[]
By the way, when configuring the folder, you can specify whether the agents for the hosts to be created there should work in xref:glossar#pull_mode[pull mode] or xref:glossar#push_mode[push mode].
endif::[]

Then comes the {CMK} agent: Here, the information for a registration request is specified by an agent rule and then packed (baked) into an agent package by the Agent Bakery.
This agent package configured for auto-registration is then installed on the hosts that are to be able to perform auto-registration.

How all of this actually works is explained in the following chapters.

ifdef::saas[]
[TIP]
====
By the way: The preconfigured agent packages that are available in {CE} for the automatic creation of hosts have been created with the feature described in this article.
====
endif::[]


[#setup_autoregister]
== Setting-up auto-registration

[#user]
=== Select user for auto-registration

ifdef::onprem[]
The permissions needed to register the agent with the {CMK} server (for TLS-encrypted data transfer) and to create hosts are contained in the xref:wato_user#roles[role] [.guihint]#Agent registration user#.
The permissions to register _new_ hosts are available in this role only from {CE} onwards.

This role is assigned to the xref:glossar#automation_user[automation user] `agent_registration`, which is set up in every {CMK} site and whose properties can be displayed via [.guihint]#Setup > Users > Users#:

.By default, this automation user only has the role [.guihint]#Agent registration user#
image::hosts_autoregister_user.png[alt="Dialog with the properties of the automation user 'agent_registration'."]
endif::[]

ifdef::saas[]
The permissions needed to register the agent with the {CMK} server (for TLS-encrypted data transfer) and to create hosts are assigned to the xref:glossar#automation_user[automation user] `agent_registration`, which is set up in every {CMK} site.
endif::[]

It makes sense to use this automation user for auto-registration, which is not allowed to do anything other than register hosts.


[#new_folder]
=== Creating a folder for the new hosts

The automatically created hosts are to be created in a new folder.
Alternatively, you can use an existing folder if you configure that folder as described below.

Start the creation of a folder with [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts > Add folder.# 
Give the new folder a name in the [.guihint]#Basic settings# box.

The [.guihint]#Network address# box includes the [.guihint]#IP address family# option.
ifdef::onprem[]
If you want the host's {CMK} agents to be set up to use the xref:glossar#pull_mode[pull mode], you can leave the default value [.guihint]#IPv4 only# unchanged.
endif::[]
For xref:glossar#push_mode[push mode], select the value [.guihint]#No IP#.
ifdef::onprem[]
This prevents the host's accessibility from being checked via xref:cmc_differences#smartping[Smart Ping].
endif::[]

In the following [.guihint]#Monitoring agents# box, you specify two important options for the auto-registration.
ifdef::onprem[]
With [.guihint]#Checkmk agent connection mode# you decide whether the {CMK} agent should work in pull mode or (as in the following image) in push mode.
This option is only available from {CE} onwards.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
With [.guihint]#Checkmk agent connection mode# you decide that the {CMK} agent should work in xref:glossar#push_mode[push mode].
endif::[]
Finally, in [.guihint]#Bake agent packages#, activate the [.guihint]#Bake a generic agent package for this folder# checkbox.
This allows you to use the xref:glossar#agent_bakery[Agent Bakery], 
to create an xref:wato_monitoringagents#agent_configurations[agent configuration] for a folder and all of the hosts it contains, *and* any hosts that may be added to this folder in the future.

endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
image::hosts_autoregister_new_folder_saas.png[alt="Dialog for creating a new folder for auto-registration."]
endif::[]

Complete the creation of the folder with [.guihint]#Save#.


[#rule_autoregister_site]
=== Creating a rule for the {CMK} site

The decision on which hosts are allowed to register automatically, what names they are given and what else happens to them following registration, 
is made in {CMK} -- not surprisingly -- with rules.
The labels with which the host's agent will register play a decisive role in this.
But first things first.

ifdef::onprem[]
The [.guihint]#Agent registration# rule set is only available from {CE} onwards.
endif::[]
You can find [.guihint]#Agent registration# under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents# (if the xref:intro_gui#show_less_more[Show more mode] is active) or by searching the [.guihint]#Setup# menu.
Start with [.guihint]#Add rule# the creation of a new rule and assign in the first box [.guihint]#Properties#, as usual with {CMK}, first an ID and a title.

In the following [.guihint]#Matching criteria# box, you specify which labels are to be accepted when the {CMK} server receives a request for registration from an agent.
These _agent labels_ are used exclusively for auto-registration and are different from the xref:glossar#label[labels] otherwise used in {CMK} to identify hosts and services.
Two agent labels are supplied by the {CMK} agent and can be selected from the list:
`cmk/os-family` contains the host's operating system which can be used, for example, to store the hosts in different folders.
`cmk/hostname-simple` contains the host name without the domain component (hence `simple`) which is intended for designating a unique host name in {CMK}.
There is no agent label with a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), as FQDN is not a property of the host, but of the network.
You can also enter your own labels with [.guihint]#Custom label#. 

The colon-separated key-value pair that makes up a label (e.g. `cmk/os-family:linux`) is evaluated separately.
This way you can explicitly specify that a key (e.g. `cmk/os-family`) must exist ([.guihint]#Exists#), may not exist ([.guihint]#Does not exist#) or is only accepted with a given value ([.guihint]#Equals#).
You can also enter a xref:regexes#[regular expression] ([.guihint]#Regex#) as the value.
If you define multiple agent labels, they will be logically linked with AND.
In the following example, in addition to the predefined label `cmk/hostname-simple`, the custom label `my_autoregister_label` is also to be checked: 

.This checks whether labels with the `cmk/hostname-simple` and `my_autoregister_label` keys exist
image::hosts_autoregister_rule_matching_criteria.png[alt="Auto-registration rule specifying the allowed labels."]

[TIP]
====
Every host that has been successfully registered automatically receives the `cmk/agent_auto_registered:yes` host label appended by {CMK}.
You cannot use this label here, however, because it is not an agent label and is only assigned _following_ the registration.
====

In the next box, [.guihint]#Action#, you determine what should happen when the evaluation of the labels takes effect: Create the host or not.
If you select [.guihint]#Stop and do not create hosts#, the rule evaluation is then complete and the next two boxes are no longer relevant.
In our example, however, hosts are to be created:

.The default action is the creation of the hosts
image::hosts_autoregister_rule_action.png[alt="Auto-registration rule specifying the action to be performed."]

In the [.guihint]#Host name computation# box, you now specify which name the host should receive.
In the [.guihint]#Host name template# box, enter the template.
Here you can use macros to read the actual values from the agent labels that you selected in the [.guihint]#Matching criteria# box above -- with `$cmk/hostname-simple$`, for example, the simple host name supplied by the {CMK} agent.
You can then modify the template, if desired, by converting to lower or upper case, and substitutions with regular expressions and with explicit host names.
These are, by the way, the same options that are available in xref:piggyback.html#renamehosts[customizing the names of piggyback hosts].
More information can also be found in the xref:user_interface#inline_help[inline help].

.Adoption of the simple host name, supplemented by the prefix `push-`
image::hosts_autoregister_rule_hostname_computation.png[alt="Auto-registration rule with host name specification."]

Finally, in the [.guihint]#Host creation# box, select the xref:new_folder[predefined folder] in which the new hosts are to land.
In addition, you can specify attributes that are to be given to the host.
You can read more about these attributes in the article on xref:hosts_setup#create_hosts[host administration].

.The new hosts should be created in the predefined `Autoregistered` folder
image::hosts_autoregister_rule_host_creation.png[alt="Auto-registration rule specifying the destination folder and host attributes."]

After saving the rule, return to the [.guihint]#Agent registration# page.
Here you will find the [.guihint]#Agent labels simulator#.
If you have defined many rules, the simulator will help you to keep track of them.
You can enter agent labels and with [.guihint]#Try out# simulate whether and which rule applies when an agent label is sent. 
The results will show you the colored traffic light symbols as described in the article on xref:wato_rules#analyse_traffic_light[rules].


[#rule_autoregister_bakery]
=== Creating a rule for the Agent Bakery

After configuring the {CMK} site in the previous section, we now deal with the {CMK} Agent Controller.
ifdef::onprem[]
For this, you use the [.guihint]#Agent controller auto-registration# rule set in the Agent Bakery, which is only available from {CE} onwards.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
For this, you use the [.guihint]#Agent controller auto-registration# rule set in the Agent Bakery.
endif::[]
You can find the rule set in the Agent Bakery under [.guihint]#Agent rules# or the quickest way is to search for it in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu.
Create a new rule.

In the [.guihint]#Agent controller auto-registration# box, provide the Agent Controller with all of the information it needs to make a registration request to the Agent Receiver:
the {CMK} server ([.guihint]#Monitoring server address#), 
if applicable, the port number for the Agent Receiver ([.guihint]#Agent receiver port#),
the {CMK} site ([.guihint]#Site to register with#) and 
the xref:user[automation user] for auto-registration.

You can also define your own labels here at the [.guihint]#Additional agent labels to send during registration# option.
For the auto-registration to work, these labels must match the ones 
which you have entered under [.guihint]#Custom label# in the xref:rule_autoregister_site[rule for the {CMK} site]:
in the example, the previously created custom label with the `my_autoregister_label` key.

With the final option [.guihint]#Keep existing connections# you determine 
whether the Agent Controller should delete ([.guihint]#no#) or keep ([.guihint]#yes#) already existing connections.
If you have configured manual connections to other {CMK} sites in addition to the automatic registration of a connection,
and want to keep these even after a restart of the Agent Controller `cmk-agent-ctl`, you should set this option to [.guihint]#yes#.

.The values for the Agent Bakery must match those of the {CMK} site
image::hosts_autoregister_rule_agent_bakery.png[alt="Auto-registration rule for Agent Bakery."]

*Important:* For the last box in this rule, [.guihint]#Conditions#, again select the predefined folder as [.guihint]#Folder#.


[#bake]
=== Baking an agent package

Now continue in the Agent Bakery with [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX#.
Click on icon:button_bake_agents[alt="Button for baking agents."] and bake yourself a new agent.
ifdef::onprem[]
As a result, in addition to the [.guihint]#Vanilla (factory settings)# agent configuration, you will receive a new line for the configuration
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
As a result, you will receive a new line for the configuration
endif::[]
in which the rule created in the previous section has been baked in:

.The [.guihint]#Agent type# column shows that the new configuration is specific to the configured folder
image::hosts_autoregister_baked_agent.png[alt="List with the new configurations of agents for auto-registration."]


[#install]
=== Download and install the agent package

The agent package must now be installed on each host that is to start auto-registration.
Download the agent package appropriate for the host's operating system and install it on the host.
The procedure is the same as usual in the Agent Bakery.
For more on this, see the articles on the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery_download[monitoring agents], 
the xref:agent_linux#install[Linux agent] and the xref:agent_windows#install[Windows agent].


[#success]
=== Process verification

After installing the agent package, the Agent Controller evaluates the `pre_configured_connections.json` file on the host
and issues the registration command for a connection that it contains.
If the Agent Receiver accepts this command, the connection will be set up and the host created in the {CMK} site.

.The automatically created host in the Setup
image::hosts_autoregister_setup_new_host.png[alt="Contents of the auto-registration folder containing the automatically created host."]

A xref:glossar#service_discovery[service discovery] is then performed and the xref:glossar#activate_changes[changes activated],
so that the host will also be visible in the monitoring.
Note that during the automatic activation, any other accumulated changes -- also from other users -- will also be activated.

This process can take several (up to 5) minutes from the installation of the agent package until the host appears in the monitoring.
You can track the individual steps in this process in [.guihint]#Setup > General > Audit log# after selecting the `wato_audit.log` file.

On the host you can use a command to display the Agent Controller's connection status, which looks like this following a successful registration in push mode:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} cmk-agent-ctl status
Version: 2.3.0b1
Agent socket: operational
IP allowlist: any


Connection: myserver/mysite
	UUID: b11af975-40a8-4574-b6cd-12dc11c6f273
	Local:
		Connection mode: push-agent
		Connecting to receiver port: 8000
		Certificate issuer: Site 'mysite' agent signing CA
		Certificate validity: Tue, 13 Feb 2024 12:50:35 +0000 - Tue, 13 Feb 2029 12:50:35 +0000
	Remote:
		Connection mode: push-agent
		Registration state: discoverable
		Host name: push-myhost
----

Automatically created hosts can also be xref:hosts_setup#hosts_autoremove[automatically removed].
From {CE} onwards, {CMK} thus provides the two most important components for the _lifecycle management_ of hosts.
ifdef::onprem[]
By the way, automatic removal also works for manually created hosts -- and in all editions.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
By the way, automatic removal also works for manually created hosts.
endif::[]


[#test]
== Testing and fault diagnosis

You can follow the individual steps in the process of the creation of the host in monitoring (creation of the host in the Setup, service discovery and activation) in the {CMK} site under [.guihint]#Setup > General > Audit log#. 
You verify the successful automatic registration on the host with the `cmk-agent-ctl status` command.

However, these verifications mentioned in the previous section will only show the desired results if the process has been successful.
If the results are not as shown above, it may be because a registration request was submitted by the Agent Controller but not accepted by the Agent Receiver.

For an overview of all registration requests that have been _rejected_ by the {CMK} site, see the [.guihint]#Agent registration# page, above,
in which you created the xref:rule_autoregister_site[rule for the {CMK} site].
There are many possible reasons for a rejection.
In the following image you can see two examples -- a misspelling (`my_autoregister_labell`) in the agent label submitted by the agent, and a host that already exists:

.Two rejected registration requests
image::hosts_autoregister_declined_requests.png[alt="List of rejected auto-registration requests."]

For each rejected request, in the first column, [.guihint]#Actions#, you can start a simulation, the result of which is displayed in the last column, [.guihint]#Simulation result#.

For a fault diagnosis beyond this, for further information see the articles on the xref:agent_linux#test[Linux agent] and the xref:agent_windows.html[Windows agent] 
-- among others -- on the topics of communication between an agent and a {CMK} site, as well as on (manual) registration.
