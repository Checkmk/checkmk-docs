:title: The {CMK} REST API
:description: With the {CMK} REST API, tasks that you would otherwise perform using the GUI can be executed by the {CMK} server via HTTP requests.


[#intro]
== Introduction

Since version {v20} {CMK} has had the REST API as its application programming interface.
With this API, via commands or scripts with HTTP requests, you can transmit tasks to be executed on a {CMK} server -- tasks that you would have performed in {CMK}'s GUI in earlier releases.

*Note:* Starting with version {v22}, the REST API completely replaces the old web API, which was sometimes called HTTP API.
The web API was removed from {CMK} with version {v22}.
In the xref:rest-web-api[last chapter] you can still find a comparison of the functionality of the REST API and the web API. 
From the table in the last chapter it will be clear that the {CMK} REST API not only replaces the web API, but also provides access to many more areas with more specific capabilities.

The _REST_ in the name of the REST API stands for _REpresentational State Transfer_, and it describes an architecture for the exchange of data on distributed systems -- especially for web services.
An API implemented according to the REST architecture follows certain principles, e.g. the client-server model, stateless communication and a uniform interface.
In practice the implementation is preferably carried out via the HTTP protocol, whereby the resources are addressed via the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and accessed using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

So much for the principles of the REST.
The advantages of these principles can be demonstrated by the concrete features provided by the {CMK} REST API:

[cols="25,~"]
|===

|Protocol |The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (*HTTP/1.1*) is used as the transport system for communication.

|Coding |The JavaScript Object Notation (*JSON*) is used as the data format.
The payload of the answers is serialized with JSON and encoded in UTF-8.
Date and time information is encoded in the *ISO-8601* format with valid time zone information.

|Language |English is the language for labels, identifiers and API documentation.

|Authentication |Access to the API is only granted to a client if it has proven its authorization by means of *HTTP authentication* -- 'Bearer' for example.

|Versioning |The API is versioned and uses a three-level numbering scheme according to the *Semantic Versioning 2.x* standard.
For details, refer to the xref:versioning[section on versioning] below.

|Documentation |The API is documented in a machine-readable structure, and in a human-readable, English format, and includes all resources, their input and output parameters and their associated value ranges.
The API is created with the *OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.x*, an API description format intended especially for REST APIs.
The API document created with this specification is displayed to the user with ReDoc, a responsive web design for OpenAPI documents.

|Code example |To demonstrate its use, sample code for various applications is provided for each request -- cURL and HTTPie for example.

|Error display |In the event of an error, the API sends numeric *HTTP status codes* and a diagnostic message for the problem, which helps to identify possible causes of incorrect requests.

|REST API classification | The API fulfills all four levels (0 to 3) of the *Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)*, which can be used to assess how much REST an API contains.
Level 1 requires the introduction of resources to enable communication via the API to individual endpoints rather than to a global one.
Level 2 is met if HTTP methods are used for the requests.
At the (highest) level 3, the API is effectively self-documenting, in that the server, when responding to a request, communicates any possible next actions and the resources to be addressed, thus enabling the client to discover the available functionality for themselves.
This provision of additional information is also known as 'Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State' (*HATEOAS*).

|===

In addition to these general comfort functions, the REST API is intended to cover the complete functionality that in earlier releases {CMK} provided via the GUI and a command interface.

{cee-only}
For features that exist only in the commercial editions, such as service level agreement (SLA) or Agent Bakery, the associated REST API methods are also provided only in these editions.


[#api_doc]
== The API documentation

[#versioning]
=== Versioning

One of the advantages of the REST API is that both the software and its documentation come from the same source -- the OpenAPI document.
Thus the API documentation always matches the software and describes exactly what the API can do.
Therefore it is not necessary to describe the reference part of the available resources, methods, parameters etc. in the {CMK} User guide
-- instead you will find the API documentation separately from this manual, directly in your {CMK} site.

The API with its documentation is versioned and uses a three-level numbering scheme in X.Y.Z format, where X stands for a main release, Y for a minor release and Z for a patch.
A new minor release contains new, backward-compatible functions, for example, new endpoints.
A new main release may contain changes that make the API incompatible with the previous main release (so-called *breaking changes*).
The version numbers of the main and minor releases are part of the URL used to send a request to the server.

*Important*: Note that the REST API follows a different versioning scheme than that for the {CMK} software.
Since a new main release of the API is necessary if there are incompatible API changes, this usually does not match the release cycle of the {CMK} software.

Nevertheless, the correlation between the versions of API documentation and {CMK} software is very straightforward, as you will learn in the next chapter.


[#access]
=== Access

The REST API documentation is available in HTML format for viewing in a Web browser.

In the {CMK} GUI, open the API documentation from the navigation bar via [.guihint]#Help > Developer resources > REST API documentation#.
The API documentation is displayed in a new browser window (or browser tab).
We will discuss this in more detail in the next chapter.

image::restapi_help_menu.png[alt="Help menu in the navigation bar.",width=50%]

*Note*: You will surely have noticed that there are more entries covering the REST API in the [.guihint]#Help# menu.
With [.guihint]#REST API introduction# you can open this article.
With [.guihint]#REST API interactive GUI# you can open another view of the REST API.
The entry is called [.guihint]#GUI# since not only are you shown the REST API functions, but because you can also interact with the API directly from the browser -- by sending requests to the server for example.
We will introduce the REST API GUI as an alternative to execution by script later in the xref:rest_api_gui[chapter on the REST API GUI].


[#structure]
=== Structure and content

The API documentation uses a responsive web design consisting of three sections:

[{image-border}]
image::restapi_redoc.png[alt="API documentation in a responsive web design with three sections."]

* The left-hand section, _Navigation_, is used for orientation, searching and a quick jump to the exact description of the entries in the central section.
The table of contents contains one entry for each API endpoint.
An endpoint uses a URL to refer to the resource that the API provides (e.g. hosts), together with the method used to access the resource (e.g. GET to display a host).
The endpoints are organized into several folders.

* The central section, _Content_, contains the hard facts on the documentation:
all information for defining a request (with parameters, value ranges, default values and descriptions) and the corresponding answers (also with all details).
The possible answers are displayed in different colors, depending on whether the returned HTTP status code signals success or an error.

* The right-hand section, [.guihint]#Request samples#, shows the method and URL for the endpoint selected in the content section, followed by several examples of requests:
the payload in JSON format (if relevant for the endpoint) and code examples, e.g. for cURL, HTTPie, Python Requests and Python Urllib.
Then follow the responses according to the HTTP status.
All code examples can be copied to the clipboard with the [.guihint]#Copy# button.

The navigation section is scroll-synchronized with the other two sections, which means that if you scroll up or down in the content section, the navigation section automatically scrolls to the appropriate entry in the table of contents.

The responsive web design ensures that the example section does not appear in a very narrow browser window (the examples are then displayed below the corresponding method), and the navigation section is converted into a menu.

In all sections you will find content that you can show and hide, for example, the entries for the endpoints in the navigation section, and nested parameters in the content section.
By clicking on [.guihint]#># or [.guihint]#Expand all# you can show the hidden contents, and with [.guihint]#&or;# or [.guihint]#Collapse all# you can hide them again.

In the next chapter you will learn how you can use the API documentation to create concrete requests from the information, send these requests to the {CMK} server, have them executed and monitor that execution and results.


[#using_the_api]
== Using the API


[#auth]
=== Authentication

In order to use the REST API in the {CMK} server from a client, the client must prove its identity.
The REST API supports the following methods for authentication: *Bearer*, *Web server* and *Cookie* -- in this order of precedence.
This means, for example, that if authentication with Bearer is successful, none of the other methods will be checked.


[#bearerauth]
==== Bearer or Header authentication

'Bearer' means the holder of an identity.
The client authenticates itself with the credentials of a user set up on the {CMK} server.
Ideally, this is the so-called xref:glossar#automation_user[automation user], which is provided in {CMK} for the execution of actions via an API.
Bearer authentication is recommended for use in scripts.

For authentication, you need the user name and the corresponding so-called _automation secret for machine accounts_, i.e. the password for the automation user.
Both items of information must be transmitted to the {CMK} server in the header of each request.
In a newly-created xref:glossar#site[site], the `automation` user will have already been created.
You can find it, like other users, under [.guihint]#Setup > Users > Users#.
Make sure that the roles and associated permissions for the automation user are set to allow you to execute your requests.

For the scripts presented in this article, the automation user is always used as the default example.


[#webserverauth]
==== Web server authentication

For web server authentication, the REST API uses the HTTP authentication configured for the web server ('Basic' or 'Digest').

This authentication method is intended for large {CMK} installations with special requirements that are realized by using and configuring software modules for authentication of the Apache web server.
If you want to use the web server authentication, you need to reconfigure the Apache web server of the {CMK} site itself.


[#cookieauth]
==== Cookie authentication

Cookie authentication is a special case of authentication by API key. Every {CMK} user who is logged into {CMK} and has been assigned an HTTP cookie can use the REST API. Cookie authentication is used for trying out and testing with the xref:rest_api_gui[REST API GUI]. Whether requests can be executed depends on whether your {CMK} user account has the appropriate permissions.


[#testing]
=== Testing the API locally

To test the REST API, it is advisable to make the requests directly from the {CMK} server, i.e. in this example client and server are on the same computer.
If you are working as a site user, you can also use local variables such as `$OMD_SITE`, which refers to the name of the site.

In the following examples, we use the sample code contained in the API documentation for the command line program cURL, which enables data to be transferred to or from a server without user interaction, for example via HTTP.

*Note:* Especially for complex requests, the cURL examples may contain inconsistencies and therefore may not always be reliable.
We therefore generally recommend HTTPie, which is more consistent, easier to understand, and better suited for use in scripts.

The `curl` command is executed within a bash script.
For the preparation, create a script file to which the sample code is later copied:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} touch rest-api_test.sh
{c-omd} chmod +x rest-api_test.sh
----

The REST API outputs all responses in a single-line JSON format.
Since formatted output is much easier to read, for formatted output the cURL sample code uses the command line JSON processor `jq`.
You can use the following command to check whether `jq` is installed:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} jq --version
jq-1.6
----

and -- if not -- install the software from link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[Github^].
If you do not want to use `jq`, you will have to cope with the unformatted output.

Before starting, gather some basic information specific to your {CMK} configuration:

[cols="25,25,~",options="header"]
|===
|Variable |Example value |Meaning 
|`HOST_NAME` |`myserver` |The {CMK} server's hostname
|`SITE_NAME` |`mysite` |The {CMK} site name
|`USERNAME` |`automation` |The automation user's name
|`PASSWORD` |`theautomationsecret` |The automation user's password
|===

These variables are used in the sample code and must be edited by you before sending a request.
In the table above you will also find the sample values used in the following.


[#making_requests]
=== Making requests using scripts

With a straightforward example we will now demonstrate how to use the REST API.
Create a host with its services using a total of three requests.
In principle, you proceed in the same way as you would with the {CMK} GUI:

. Create a host
. Perform a service discovery on the host
. Activate the changes


==== Creating a host

Open the API documentation and select the entry for creating a host ([.guihint]#Create a host#) in the left navigation area:

[{image-border}]
image::restapi_redoc_2pane.png[alt="The entry in the API documentation for creating a host."]

In the central part of the panel you can see the details for the selected request, which HTTP authentication is required (this is identical for all requests via the REST API), and the required and optional parameters.
The name of the host and the folder in which it should be created is required.
By default, the host is created in the [.guihint]#Main# directory. 
If you want to create the host in another folder, you may first need to make another API request ([.guihint]#Show all folders#) to view the existing folders to determine the ID of the one you want to use.

In our example, we want to create the host `myhost123` with the IP address `192.168.0.42` in the [.guihint]#Main# folder.

In the API documentation, click the [.guihint]#curl# button in the right-hand example area and then click [.guihint]#Copy# to copy the cURL sample code to the clipboard.
Open the prepared script `rest-api_test.sh` and paste the clipboard's contents into it:

.rest-api_test.sh
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/bash

HOST_NAME="localhost"
SITE_NAME="mysite"
API_URL="http://$HOST_NAME/$SITE_NAME/check_mk/api/1.0"

USERNAME="automation"
PASSWORD="test123"

out=$(
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --write-out "\nxxx-status_code=%{http_code}\n" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
    --header "Accept: application/json" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
          "attributes": {
            "ipaddress": "192.168.0.123"
          },
          "folder": "/",
          "host_name": "example.com"
        }' \
    "$API_URL/domain-types/host_config/collections/all")

resp=$( echo "${out}" | grep -v "xxx-status_code" )
code=$( echo "${out}" | awk -F"=" '/^xxx-status_code/ {print $2}')

# For indentation, please install 'jq' (JSON query tool)
echo "$resp" | jq
# echo "$resp"

if [[ $code -lt 400 ]]; then
    echo "OK"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Request error"
    exit 1
fi
----

In the first part of the sample code you will find the environment variables, then comes the `curl` command with the POST method on the resource whose URL is in the last line.
With the POST method, following the header lines (one of which defines the HTTP authentication), you will find the data section where the parameters for the new host are specified.
The remaining lines are used to prepare the output.

Note that the cURL sample code may contain more parameters than you might need for a specific situation.
For our example this is not the case and you only need to change the two existing parameters, `host_name` and `ipaddress`.

Now edit the sample code so that the result looks something like this:

.rest-api_test.sh
[{file},highlight=3;4;7;8;19;22]
----
#!/bin/bash

HOST_NAME="myserver"
SITE_NAME="mysite"
API_URL="http://$HOST_NAME/$SITE_NAME/check_mk/api/1.0"

USERNAME="automation"
PASSWORD="theautomationsecret"

out=$(
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --write-out "\nxxx-status_code=%{http_code}\n" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
    --header "Accept: application/json" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
          "attributes": {
            "ipaddress": "192.168.0.42"
          },
          "folder": "/",
          "host_name": "myhost123"
        }' \
    "$API_URL/domain-types/host_config/collections/all")

resp=$( echo "${out}" | grep -v "xxx-status_code" )
code=$( echo "${out}" | awk -F"=" '/^xxx-status_code/ {print $2}')

# For indentation, please install 'jq' (JSON query tool)
echo "$resp" | jq
# echo "$resp"

if [[ $code -lt 400 ]]; then
    echo "OK"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Request error"
    exit 1
fi
----

If the `jq` command line JSON processor is not installed, you must comment out the line with `jq` in the above sample code and comment in the line following it. The result then looks like this:

.rest-api_test.sh
[{file}]
----
# echo "$resp" | jq
echo "$resp"
----

Run the script:

[{shell},highlight=32;33;36;38]
----
{c-omd} ./rest-api_test.sh

    {
      "domainType": "link",
      "rel": "self",
      "href": "\http://myserver/mysite/check_mk/api/1.0/objects/host_config/myhost123",
      "method": "GET",
      "type": "application/json"
    },
    {
      "domainType": "link",
      "rel": "urn:org.restfulobjects:rels/update",
      "href": "\http://myserver/mysite/check_mk/api/1.0/objects/host_config/myhost123",

      "method": "GET",
      "type": "application/json",
      "title": "Download the windows_msi agent of the host."
    }
  ],
  "domainType": "host_config",
  "id": "myhost123",
  "title": "myhost123",
  "members": {},
  "extensions": {
    "folder": "/",
    "attributes": {
      "ipaddress": "192.168.0.42",

    },
    "effective_attributes": null,
    "is_cluster": false,
    "is_offline": false,
    "cluster_nodes": null
  }
}
OK
----

In the response, the first 3 lines contain information on the data transmission.
Then, under `links`, the API returns a selection of requests (heavily truncated in the above example) which can be applied to the host just created -- as befits a REST API.
Finally, the API returns the ID and name (`title`) of the created host, the folder (`/` for the main folder), and under `attributes` the attributes assigned to the host including its IP address.


==== Perform a service discovery on the host

Once the host `myhost123` has been created, its services can be discovered.

*Note:* To ensure that a xref:glossar#service_discovery[service discovery] actually delivers the expected services, on Linux and Windows hosts you must first install and register their respective xref:glossar#agent[agents].

To execute a service discovery via REST API, select the appropriate entry in the API documentation ([.guihint]#Execute a service discovery on a host#), copy the sample code into the script, and customize it to your configuration.

You can copy the first part with the environment variables 1:1 from the previous example.
In the `curl` command, change the name of the host to `myhost123` and, if necessary, use the `mode` parameter to change the type of service discovery.

.rest-api_test.sh
[{file},highlight=3;4;7;8;18;19]
----
#!/bin/bash

    --request POST \
    --write-out "\nxxx-status_code=%{http_code}\n" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
    --header "Accept: application/json" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
          "host_name": "myhost123",
          "mode": "refresh"
        }' \
    "$API_URL/domain-types/service_discovery_run/actions/start/invoke")

resp=$( echo "${out}" | grep -v "xxx-status_code" )
code=$( echo "${out}" | awk -F"=" '/^xxx-status_code/ {print $2}')

# For indentation, please install 'jq' (JSON query tool)
echo "$resp" | jq
# echo "$resp"

if [[ $code -lt 400 ]]; then
    echo "OK"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Request error"
    exit 1
fi
----

Execute this script as well:

[{shell},highlight=5]
----
{c-omd} ./rest-api_test.sh
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

OK
----

Success is reported succinctly at the end of the output with `OK`.


==== Activate the changes

Finally, the changes must be activated. The appropriate request is called [.guihint]#Activate pending changes#.

As before, take the first part with the environment variables from the previous examples.
In the data part of the `curl` command change the parameter `sites` and set it to the name of the site on which the changes should be activated:

.rest-api_test.sh
[{file},highlight=3;4;7;8;21]
----
#!/bin/bash

HOST_NAME="myserver"
SITE_NAME="mysite"
API_URL="http://$HOST_NAME/$SITE_NAME/check_mk/api/1.0"

out=$(
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --write-out "\nxxx-status_code=%{http_code}\n" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
    --header "Accept: application/json" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \

          ]
        }' \
    "$API_URL/domain-types/activation_run/actions/activate-changes/invoke")

resp=$( echo "${out}" | grep -v "xxx-status_code" )
code=$( echo "${out}" | awk -F"=" '/^xxx-status_code/ {print $2}')

# For indentation, please install 'jq' (JSON query tool)

    "sites": [
      "mysite"
    ],

      }
    ]
  }
}
OK
----

The `title` text indicates that the activation has been started.
Again, the REST API suggests two useful follow-up requests under `links`:
to query the status of this activation, and to wait for its completion.


[#rest_api_gui]
=== Making requests via the REST API GUI

With the REST API *GUI* you get a new perspective on the API.
With this GUI you can interact directly with the API from the browser by sending requests to the server via cURL commands, and immediately see the responses.
To do this, you have to do without the code examples of the REST API documentation in the API GUI
-- both views are optimized for their respective functions.

The REST API GUI is generated from the same source as the REST API documentation -- the OpenAPI document -- and therefore always provides functions that match the API.

You open the API GUI in the {CMK} GUI from the navigation bar, menu [.guihint]#Help > Developer resources > REST API interactive GUI#.
The API GUI is displayed in a new browser window (or browser tab):

[{image-border}]
image::restapi_swaggerui.png[alt="The entry in the REST API GUI to create a host."]

In the following we outline how you can execute the first request from the above example (create a host) with the REST API GUI instead of using a script:

. Authenticate:
The REST API GUI offers a dialog box for entering authentication information after clicking the [.guihint]#Authorize# button (on the right side above the entry for the first endpoint folder).
However, you *do not need* to make any entries there, because as a logged-in {CMK} user you are already authorized to use the REST API via xref:auth[cookie authentication].

. Select the endpoint:
In the [.guihint]#Hosts# folder, select the endpoint [.guihint]#Create a host# and click [.guihint]#Try it out#.

. Enter parameter values:
In [.guihint]#Request body# overwrite the example values for `host_name` and `ipaddress`.

. Send a request:
Click [.guihint]#Execute#.

. Check the response:
Under [.guihint]#Responses# you will first see the sent cURL command and the URL of the endpoint.
Then under [.guihint]#Server response# the response is displayed with HTTP status code and in [.guihint]#Responses# with the (multi-line formatted) REST API response.

The REST API GUI therefore offers you the opportunity to try out the functions of the API quickly and easily, and to familiarize yourself with the functions of the input values as well as with concrete responses.


[#error_correction]
=== Error correction

In contrast to the output from successful commands via script shown so far, the REST API shows you errors in the following way:

[{shell}]
----
{
  "title": "The operation has failed.",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": "There are changes from other users and foreign changes are not allowed in this API call."
}
Request error
----

Depending on the error, the parameters displayed in the output may vary.
However, in `status` the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes[HTTP status code^], and in `title` they always receive a brief description of the cause of the error.

In most cases, `detail` will show you detailed information, as the name suggests.
In the above example, you can see that there are pending changes in {CMK}, but these were initiated by another user.
By default, only changes that have also been made via the API can be activated via the API.

In the next example, the helpful messages are also in the detailed information:

[{shell}]
----
{
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "400 Bad Request: Failed to decode JSON object: Invalid \\escape: line 6 column 31 (char 136)"
}
Request error
----

The problem in the above example is that a parameter value does not adhere to the valid value range because the host name contains a slash.

The number of possible errors is of course much greater than the two we have presented here.
However, you can see from the examples shown that in its output the REST API usually provides sufficient information on the cause and thus gives you clues for starting the analysis and troubleshooting.


[#securing]
== Securing the API

Since sensitive data can be transferred during access via the REST API and -- depending on the authorization of the automation user -- considerable alterations could potentially be made to {CMK}, you should secure such access accordingly.
Here you will find some of the available options:

* xref:omd_https#[{CMK} over HTTPS]:
Use the API exclusively over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), otherwise user names, passwords, and also configuration data will be transmitted in clear text on the network.

* Give the automation user a password of sufficient length.
Since the password is usually only stored in a script, you can easily assign a very long one.

* Be sure to pay careful attention to the authorization concept for the scripts you use to make requests to the API.
The scripts may contain sensitive data such as configuration data, passwords, etc.
Therefore make sure that only authorized users and groups can read these scripts.


[#examples]
== Examples with REST API requests

In this chapter you will find examples that show how to perform commonly needed actions using the REST API.
The examples are again based on the sample code for the _cURL_ command line program.
In contrast to the procedure in the chapter xref:using_the_api[Using the API], however, here the requests are made as `curl` commands on the command line rather than by script.
This allows you to try out our examples right away -- after you have customized them to suit your own environment.

In order to present the commands clearly here, we have only shown the lines from the sample code that are absolutely necessary for the command execution.
The REST API's responses are by default unformatted, and you can format them by redirecting the output back to the command line JSON processor `jq` by appending a `| jq` to the end of a `curl` command.
More info on `jq` is provided earlier in this article in the chapter xref:testing[Testing the API locally].

As with the sample code in the API documentation, the examples in this chapter contain variables for assembling the base URL for the REST API on your {CMK} server and for setting the credentials for the xref:glossar#automation_user[automation user] for the xref:bearerauth[Bearer authentication] used:

[cols="15,35,~",options="header"]
|===
|Variable |Example value |Description
|`HOST_NAME` |`myserver` |Name of the {CMK} server
|`SITE_NAME` |`mysite` |Name of the {CMK} site
|`API_URL` |`\http://$HOST_NAME/$SITE_NAME/check_mk/api/1.0` |Base URL of the REST API
|`USERNAME` |`automation` |Name of the automation user
|`PASSWORD` |`theautomationsecret` |Password of the automation user
|===

Before issuing the `curl` commands, you can tailor the variables to suit your environment using the following shell commands:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} HOST_NAME="myserver"; SITE_NAME="mysite"; API_URL="http://$HOST_NAME/$SITE_NAME/check_mk/api/1.0"; \
USERNAME="automation"; PASSWORD="theautomationsecret";
----


[#examples_hosts_folders]
=== Hosts and folders

The requests described in this chapter can be found in the API documentation in the [.guihint]#Hosts# and [.guihint]#Folders# subfolders.
The titles of the respective endpoints contained in the API documentation are the following headings.

[#restapi_show_all_folders]
[discrete]
=== Show all folders

Here _all_ folders in the Setup are displayed -- recursively starting from the [.guihint]#Main# folder -- _without_ listing the hosts they contain:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl -G \
--request GET \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--data-urlencode #'parent=~'# \
--data-urlencode #'recursive=true'# \
--data-urlencode #'show_hosts=false'# \
"$API_URL/domain-types/folder_config/collections/all"
----


[#restapi_show_all_hosts_in_a_folder]
[discrete]
=== Show all hosts in a folder


Here the hosts in the [.guihint]#Main > Linux# subfolder are requested:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request GET \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
"$API_URL/objects/folder_config/#~linux#/collections/hosts"
----


[#restapi_create_a_folder]
[discrete]
=== Create a folder

Here a subfolder [.guihint]#Production Hosts# is created in [.guihint]#Main > Linux# -- in the file system as the directory `production_hosts`.
The new folder is thereby assigned the [.guihint]#Productive system# xref:glossar#host_tag[host tag] from the xref:host_tags#predefined_tags[predefined host tag group] [.guihint]#Criticality#:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json"     \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
    "attributes": {
        "tag_criticality": "prod"
    },
    "name": "production_hosts",
    "parent": "~linux",
    "title": "Production Hosts"
    }' \
"$API_URL/domain-types/folder_config/collections/all"
----


[#restapi_create_a_host]
[discrete]
=== Create a host

Here, in the [.guihint]#Main > Linux > Production Hosts# folder, the host `mylinuxserver` is created with the IP address `192.168.0.123` and the [.guihint]#Use piggyback data from other hosts if present# host tag:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
    "attributes": {
        "ipaddress": "192.168.0.123",
        "tag_piggyback": "auto-piggyback"
    },
    "folder": "\~linux~production_hosts",
    "host_name": "mylinuxserver"
    }' \
"$API_URL/domain-types/host_config/collections/all"
----


[#restapi_show_a_host]
[discrete]
=== Show a host

By displaying a host you receive a list of the attributes assigned to it.
This additionally provides the HTTP ETag (_entity tag_) that you need to be able to modify a host.
Modifying an object via REST API is not done using the object's ID or title. Instead, the generated ETag is used, which is intended to prevent multiple competing requests from overwriting each other's values for the same object.

The ETag is returned in the response header.
To display this header, call `curl` with the `-v` option (for _verbose_).
Here the host `mylinuxserver` is queried -- and from the response only the line containing the ETag is shown:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl -vG \
--request GET \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
"$API_URL/objects/host_config/#mylinuxserver#"
...
< ETag: "57db3792f23bd81ca7447ba4885fa2865d0c78aed4753229b29e179e539da48b"
...
----


[#restapi_update_a_host]
[discrete]
=== Update a host

Before making the change, get that host's ETag as described in the preceding section xref:restapi_show_a_host[Show a host].
You then enter the ETag in the request header under `If-Match`.
Here, the host tag from the [.guihint]#Piggyback# group that was specified when the host was created is deleted, and the predefined tag [.guihint]#API integrations if configured, else Checkmk agent# is specified to replace it:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request PUT \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "If-Match: "57db3792f23bd81ca7447ba4885fa2865d0c78aed4753229b29e179e539da48b"" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
    "remove_attributes": [
        "tag_piggyback"
    ],
    "update_attributes": {
        "tag_agent": "cmk-agent"
    }
    }' \
"$API_URL/objects/host_config/#mylinuxserver#"
----


[#restapi_execute_a_service_discovery_on_a_host]
[discrete]
=== Execute a service discovery on a host

To ensure that a xref:hosts_setup#services[service discovery] actually delivers the expected services, on Linux and Windows hosts you must first install and register their respective xref:wato_monitoringagents#[monitoring agents].

Here, a service discovery is performed on the host `mylinuxserver` with the `refresh` option, which corresponds to the [.guihint]#Full service scan# button in the {CMK} GUI:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
    "host_name": "mylinuxserver",
    "mode": "refresh"
    }' \
"$API_URL/domain-types/service_discovery_run/actions/start/invoke"
----


[#restapi_bulk_create_host]
[discrete]
=== Bulk create hosts

Here, two hosts are created in the [.guihint]#Main > Linux > Production Hosts# folder: the first host with only an IP address, and the second host with a xref:monitoring_basics#parents[parent host] and two xref:glossar#label[labels] in addition to its IP address:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
	"entries": [
	{
	"attributes": {
	    "ipaddress": "192.168.0.130"
	},
	"folder": "\~linux~production_hosts",
	"host_name": "mylinuxserver02"
	},
	{
	"attributes": {
	    "ipaddress": "192.168.0.131",
	    "parents": [ "router01" ],
	    "labels": {
	    	"color": "blue-metallic",
	    	"admin": "Fozzie Bear"
	    }
	},
	"folder": "\~linux~production_hosts",
	"host_name": "mylinuxserver03"
	}
	]
	}' \
"$API_URL/domain-types/host_config/actions/bulk-create/invoke"
----


[#restapi_activate_pending_changes]
[discrete]
=== Activate pending changes

Before the complex action of renaming a host can be tackled, it is necessary to activate all changes that have accumulated in its xref:glossar#configuration_environment[configuration environment].
Here the changes for the site `mysite` are all activated in a single action:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
    "force_foreign_changes": false,
    "redirect": false,
    "sites": [
        "mysite"
     ]
     }' \
"$API_URL/domain-types/activation_run/actions/activate-changes/invoke"
----


[#restapi_bulk_rename_a_host]
[discrete]
=== Rename a host

A new name is also going to change the host.
Therefore, first get the host's current ETag, e.g. from `mylinuxserver`, as described in the xref:restapi_show_a_host[Show a host] section, and enter this into the request header under `If-Match`.
Here the host is being renamed as `mylinuxserver01`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} curl \
--request PUT \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $USERNAME $PASSWORD" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "If-Match: "a200832df1b3c5ebe8f30809177630abbdcf8f7cbd9d0f69bd9f229b359f4d00"" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
	"new_name": "mylinuxserver01"
	}' \
"$API_URL/objects/host_config/#mylinuxserver#/actions/rename/invoke"

[#rest-web-api]
== The REST API functions

This chapter gives you an overview of the functions available to you via the REST API.
The following tables are structured according to the endpoints that you will find in the left navigation area of the REST API documentation.
In the table, the column for the REST API contains the HTTP methods (supplemented with context information in case of ambiguity)
The last column contains the corresponding commands in the web API included in {CMK} up to version {v21}.
