With the link:https://slack.com/[Slack^] messenger you can conveniently receive notifications via a webhook.
This works on self-hosted or rented servers, as well as via the free public Slack service.


[#config_slack]
== Configuring Slack

To activate webhooks and create a new webhook, you must first create a Slack app.
Log in to Slack and create a _Workspace_.
Then proceed as follows:

. Create a new app via link:https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks[this link^] using the Slack API.
. Assign any name you like and choose your workspace.
. In the next dialog choose [.guihint]#Incoming Webhook# as the app function.
. Next activate webhooks by setting the switch to [.guihint]#on#.
. Create the webhook with the [.guihint]#Add New Webhook to Workspace# button.
. Finally, set the channel (group) where the app should post to, and confirm the rights request.

For testing purposes, on completion you will receive a `curl` statement which posts _Hello World_ to the desired channel.
Copy the webhook URL and switch to {CMK}.


[#config_checkmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

In {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the URL copied above:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Slack or Mattermost#.
. Enter the copied webhook URL:
+

+
Instead of entering the URL directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI within the notification.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:

With the new xref:notifications#notification_testing[Test notifications] function, you can check whether your new notification rule applies to certain hosts and services.

To actually send test notifications via this notification method, you must continue to use xref:notifications#fake_check_results[Fake check results] in {CMK} {v23}.
