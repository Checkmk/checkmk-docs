In this article we explain the basic terms and concepts in {CMK}, such as host, service, user, contact group, notification, time period, scheduled downtime.

[#states_events]
== States and events

It is important to understand the basic differences between _states_ and _events_ -- and namely for a very practical benefit.
Most classic IT monitoring systems revolve around events.
An event is something that occurs uniquely at a particular time.
A good example would be _error when accessing drive X_.
Typical sources of events are syslog messages, SNMP traps, the Windows Event Log, and log file entries.
Events are quasi-spontaneous (self-generating, asynchronous) occurrences.

In contrast a _state_ describes a sustained situation, e.g.  _drive X is online_.
In order to observe the state of something, the monitoring system must regularly poll it.
As the example shows, in monitoring it is often possible to choose to work with events or with states.

{CMK} can accommodate both states and events, but, where the choice is available, it will always prioritize _state-based monitoring_.
The reason for this lies in the numerous advantages with this method.
Some of these are:

* An error in the monitoring itself is detected immediately, because it is obviously noticeable when the state query no longer works.
The non-occurrence of a _message_, on the other hand, does not give any certainty that the monitoring is still working.
* {CMK} itself can control the rate at which states are polled.
There is no risk of an _event storm_ in global error situations.
* Regular checking in a fixed time-frame enables the capturing of xref:glossar#metric[metrics] to record their time history.
* Even in chaotic situations -- a power failure in a data center, for example -- one always has a reliable overall state.

One can well say that {CMK}'s state-based monitoring is the _norm_.
ifdef::onprem[]
For processing events there is also the xref:glossar#ec[Event Console].
This is specialized for the correlation and evaluation of large numbers of events and is seamlessly-integrated into the {CMK} platform.

[#hosts_services]
== Hosts and services

[#hosts]
=== Hosts

Everything in {CMK} revolves around _hosts_ and _services_.
A host can be many things, e.g.:

* A server
ifdef::onprem[]
* A network device (switch, router, load balancer)
endif::[]
* A measuring device with an IP connection (thermometer, hygrometer)
* Anything else with an IP address
* A cluster of several hosts
* A virtual machine
* A Docker container

In monitoring a host always has one of the following states:

[cols="10,10,~",options="header"]
|===
|State |Color |Meaning 
|{UP} |green |The host is accessible via the network (this generally means that it answers a PING.)
|{DOWN} |red |The host does not answer network inquiries, is not accessible.
|{UNREACH} |orange |The _path_ to the host is currently blocked to monitoring, because a router or switch in the path has failed.
|{PEND} |gray |The host has been newly-included in the monitoring, but never before been polled. Strictly-speaking this is not really a state.
|===

Alongside the state, a host has a number of other attributes that can be configured by the user, e.g.:

* A unique name
* An IP address
* Optional - an alias, that must not be unique
* Optional - one or more _parents_


[#parents]
=== Parents

For the monitoring to be able to determine the {UNREACH} state, it must know which path it can use to contact each individual host.
For this purpose, one or more so-called _parent hosts_ can be specified for each host.
For example, if a server A _as seen from monitoring_ can only be reached via a router B, then B is a parent host of A.
Only _direct_ parents are xref:hosts_structure#parents[configured in {CMK}].
This then results in a tree-like structure with the {CMK} site in the middle (shown here as icon:parent_map_root[alt="Icon for the {CMK} site."]):

image::monitoring_basics_parents.png[alt="Network topology with a configured parent.",width=43%,align=center]

Let's assume that in the network topology example shown above, the hosts _myhost_ and _myhost4_ are no longer reachable.
The failure of _myhost4_ can be explained by the fact that _myhost_ has failed.
Therefore, _myhost4_ is classified as {UNREACH} in the monitoring.
It is simply not possible to clearly determine why {CMK} can no longer reach _myhost4_, and the {DOWN} state would therefore be misleading in some circumstances.
Instead, the {UNREACH} has the effect of suppressing xref:notifications#[notifications] by default.
This is after all the most important task of the parents concept, i.e. the avoidance of mass notifications in the event that an entire dependent network segment becomes unreachable for the monitoring due to an interruption at a single point.

ifdef::onprem[]
The prevention of false alarms is also served by xref:cmc_differences#no_on-demand_host_checks[feature] of the {CMK} Micro Core (CMC) used in the commercial editions.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
The prevention of false alarms is also served by xref:cmc_differences#no_on-demand_host_checks[feature] of the {CMK} Micro Core (CMC).
endif::[]
Here, the state change for a failed host is held back for a few moments and proceeds only when it is _certain_ that the parent is still reachable.
If, on the other hand, the parent is definitely {DOWN}, the host will switch to {UNREACH} -- without a notification being triggered.

In some cases a host could have multiple parents, for example, when a router is running highly available in a cluster.
It is sufficient for {CMK} to be able to uniquely determine the state of the host when one of these parents is reachable.
Thus, when a host has _multiple_ parents and at least one of these parents is {UP}, the host is considered reachable in the monitoring.
In other words, in such a situation, the host will not automatically switch to the {UNREACH} state.


[#services]
=== Services

A host has a number of _services_.
A service can be anything -- don't confuse this with services in Windows.
A service is any part or aspect of the host that can be {OK}, or not OK.
Naturally the state can only be determined if the host is in {UP} state.

A service being monitored can have the following states:

[cols="10,10,~",options="header"]
|===
|State |Color |Meaning 
|{OK} |green |The service is fully in order. All values are in their allowed range.
|{WARN} |yellow |The service is functioning normally, but its parameters are outside their optimal range.
|{CRIT} |red |The service has failed.
|{UNKNOWN} |orange |The service's state cannot be correctly determined. The monitoring agent has delivered defective data or the element being monitored has disappeared.
|{PEND} |gray |The service has been newly-included and has so far not provided monitoring data.
|===

When determining which condition is 'worse', {CMK} utilizes the following sequence:

{OK} → {WARN} → {UNKNOWN} → {CRIT}


[#checks]
=== Checks

A xref:glossar#check[check] ensures that a host or a service can be assigned a state.
Which states these can be is described in the previous section.
Services and checks are closely related.
For this reason these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, perhaps even in this User Guide, although they are in fact different things.

In the Setup you can display which xref:glossar#check_plugin[check plug-in] is responsible for each service.
Open the properties of a host with [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts# and then in the [.guihint]#Host > Run service discovery# menu the list of the services for this host.
Then use [.guihint]#Display > Show plugin names# to display a new column which will show the check plug-in responsible for each service:

.We have omitted the [.guihint]#Summary# table column, which is not relevant here
image::monitoring_basics_services_checks.png[]

As you can see from the example of the [.guihint]#df# check plug-in, a check plug-in can be responsible for more than one service.
By the way, the names of the check plug-ins listed in the column are also links that show a description of the check plug-in.

The connection and dependency of services and checks can also be seen in the monitoring.
In the service list for a host in monitoring, you can see that in the icon:icon_menu[] action menu at the [.guihint]#Reschedule# entry, there is a yellow arrow for some services (icon:icon_reload[]), but a gray arrow for most of the others (icon:icon_reload_cmk[]).
A service with the yellow arrow is based on an xref:glossar#active_check[active check]:

image::monitoring_basics_check_mk_service.png[]

Such an active check is executed directly by {CMK}.
Services with the gray arrow are based on passive checks whose data is fetched from another service, the [.guihint]#Check_MK# service.
This is done for performance reasons and is a special feature of {CMK}.


[#host_service_groups]
== Host and service groups

To improve the overview, you can organize hosts into xref:glossar#host_group[host groups] and services into xref:glossar#service_group[service groups].
A host/service can also be in more than one group.
The creation of these groups is optional and not necessary for the configuration.
However, if for example you have set up the folder structure according to geographic locations, it could be useful to create a host group `Linux servers` which groups all Linux servers together, no matter where they are located.

You can find out more about host groups in the article on the xref:hosts_structure#host_groups[structuring of hosts] and about service groups in the article on xref:wato_services#service_groups[services].


[#contacts]
== Contacts and contact groups

xref:glossar#contact[Contacts] and contact groups offer the possibility of assigning persons to hosts and services.
A contact correlates with a user name or web interface.
The correlation with hosts and services does not occur directly however, rather via contact groups.

Firstly, a contact (e.g. `harri`) is assigned to a contact group (e.g. `linux-admins`).
Then hosts -- or as required, individual services -- can be assigned to the contact group.
In this way users, and likewise hosts and services can be assigned to multiple contact groups.

These assignments are useful for a number of reasons:

. Who is permitted to _view_ something?
. Who is authorized to _configure and control_ which hosts and services?
. Who receives _notifications_, and for which problems?

ifdef::onprem[]
By the way -- the user `cmkadmin`, who is automatically defined by the creation of a site, is always permitted to view all hosts and services even when this user is not a contact.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
By the way -- the user with administrator rights, who is automatically created after the initial registration, is always permitted to view all hosts and services even when this user is not a contact.
endif::[]
This is determined through their role as administrator.


[#users_roles]
== Users and roles

While contacts and contact groups control who is responsible for a particular host or service, permissions are controlled by _roles_.
ifdef::onprem[]
{CMK} is supplied with a number of predefined roles from which you can later derive further roles as required.
Each role defines a set of permissions which can later be customized.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
{CE} is supplied with a number of predefined roles.
Each role defines a set of permissions.
endif::[]
The meaning of the standard roles is:

ifdef::onprem[]
[cols="15,20,~",options="header"]
|===
|Role name
|Alias
|Description

|`admin`
|Administrator
|May see and do everything, has all permissions.

|`user`
|Normal monitoring user
|May only see what they are a contact for.
May manage hosts in folders assigned to them.
May not make global settings.

|`agent_registration`
|Agent registration user
|May only register a host's xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agent] with the {CMK} server -- nothing else.

|`guest`
|Guest user
|May see everything, but may not configure anything or intervene in monitoring.

|`no_permissions`
|no_permissions
|Must not do anything.
|===
endif::[]

ifdef::saas[]
[cols="20,~",options="header"]
|===
|Role name
|Description

|Administrator
|May see and do everything, has all permissions.

|Normal monitoring user
|May only see what they are a contact for.
May manage hosts in folders assigned to them.
May not make global settings.
|===
endif::[]


== Problems, events and notifications

[#problems]
=== Handled and unhandled problems

{CMK} identifies every host that is not {UP}, and every service that is not {OK} as a _problem_.
A problem can have two states: _unhandled_ and _handled_.
The procedure is that a new problem is first treated as unhandled.
As soon as someone _acknowledges_ the problem it will be flagged as _handled_, and no surprise, _unhandled_ problems are those which have not yet been attended to.
The xref:user_interface#overview[Overview] in the sidebar therefore differentiates these two types of problems:

image::overview_more.png[alt="Overview snap-in in Show more mode.",width=50%]

By the way: service problems from hosts that are currently not {UP} are not identified as problems.

Further details on acknowledgments can be found in its xref:basics_ackn#[own article].


[#notifications]
=== Notifications

When a host's state changes, (e.g. from {OK} to {CRIT}), {CMK} registers a _monitoring event_.
These events may or may not generate a xref:glossar#notification[notification].
{CMK} is so designed that whenever a host or service has a problem, an email is sent to the object's contacts
(note that every newly created user by default, is _not_ a contact for any objects).
These can be customized very flexibly however.
Notifications also depend on a number of parameters.
It is simplest when we look at cases for which notifications are _not_ sent.
Notifications are suppressed ...

* ...when notifications have been globally deactivated in the xref:user_interface#master_control[Master control],
* ...when notifications have been deactivated in the host/service,
* ...when notifications have been deactivated for a particular state of the host/service (e.g. no notifications for {WARN}),
* ...when the problem affects a service whose host is {DOWN} or {UNREACH},
* ...when the problem affects a host, whose parents are all {DOWN} or {UNREACH},
* ...when for the host/service a _notification period_ has been set that is not currently active,
* ...when the host/service is currently xref:flapping[flapping] icon:icon_flapping[],
* ...when the host/service is currently in a xref:downtimes[scheduled downtime]

If none of these prerequisites for suppressing notifications are satisfied, the monitoring core then creates a notification, 
which in a second step passes through a chain of rules.
In these rules you can define further exclusion criteria, and decide whom should be notified and in what form (email, SMS, etc.)

All particulars concerning notifications can be found in their own xref:notifications#[Notifications] article.


[#flapping]
=== Flapping hosts and services

It sometimes happens that a service continuously and quickly changes its condition.
In order to avoid continuous notifications, {CMK} switches such a service into the _flapping_ state.
This is illustrated with the icon:icon_flapping[] icon.

When a service enters a flapping state, a notification will be generated which informs the user of the situation, and silences further notifications.
After a suitable time, if no further rapid changes are occurring, and a final (good or bad) state is evident, then the flapping state disappears and normal notifications resume.


[#downtimes]
=== Scheduled downtimes

If you perform maintenance work on a server, device or software, you will normally want to avoid problem notifications during this time.
In addition, you will probably want to advise your colleagues that problems appearing in monitoring during this time may be temporarily ignored.

For this purpose you can enter a condition of _scheduled downtimes_ on a host or service.
This can can be done directly before starting the work, or in advance.
Scheduled downtimes are illustrated by the icons:

[cols="5,~"]
|===
|icon:icon_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for services."] |The service is in a scheduled downtime.
|icon:icon_derived_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for hosts."] |The host is in a scheduled downtime.
Services whose host is in a downtime are also marked with this icon.
|===

While a host or service has a scheduled downtime:

* No notifications will be sent.
* Problems will not be shown in the [.guihint]#Overview# snap-in.

Additionally, when you wish to later document statistics on the availability of hosts and services 
it is a good idea to include scheduled downtimes.
These can be factored into later availability evaluations.


[#stale]
=== Stale hosts and services

If you have been working with {CMK} for a while, it is possible that spider webs will be displayed in your host and service views.
For services, for example, it looks like this:

image::monitoring_basics_stale.png[alt="View of two services in the stale state."]

These spider webs symbolize the _stale_ state.
Whenever there is a stale host or service, this will also be shown in the xref:user_interface.html#overview[[.guihint]#Overview#] snap-in, which will be extended by the column [.guihint]#Stale#.

But what exactly does the _stale_ state mean?
In general, a host or service is marked as _stale_ when {CMK} no longer receives up-to-date information about its state over a longer period of time:

* A service will become _stale_:
If an agent or even just an agent plug-in fails -- for whatever reason -- over a longer period of time, the agent will no longer provide current data for evaluation.
Services whose state is determined by passive checks cannot be updated, as these depend on the agent's data.  
The services remain in their last state, but are marked as _stale_ after a certain time has elapsed.

* A host becomes _stale_:
If the [.guihint]#Host check command#, which checks the connectivity of the host, provides no up-to-date response, the host retains the last determined state -- but is then marked as _stale_.

You can adjust the time limit after which the hosts and services become _stale_.
For this, read the section on xref:checkinterval[check intervals].


[#time_periods]
== Time periods

[{image-left}]
image::timeperiods.png[width=8%]

Weekly recurring time periods are used in various places in the configuration.
A typical time period could be called `working hours` and include the times from 8:00 to 17:00 each day, on all days of the week except Saturday and Sunday.
The period `24X7` is predefined, which simply includes every day.
Time periods can also include exceptions for certain calendar days -- e.g. for the Bavarian public holidays.

Some important points where time periods are used are:

* Limiting the times within which notifications are made (notification period).
* Limiting the times within which checks are executed (xref:checkperiod[check period]).
* Service times for calculating availability (service period).
ifdef::onprem[]
* Times within which certain rules in the xref:glossar#ec[Event Console] will take effect.
endif::[]

You can read how to set periods in the xref:timeperiods#[Time periods] article.


[#check_period_interval_attempt]
== Check periods, check intervals and check attempts


[#checkperiod]
=== Specifying check periods

You can restrict the time periods in which checks are executed.
The rule sets [.guihint]#Check period for hosts#, [.guihint]#Check period for active services# and [.guihint]#Check period for passive Checkmk services# serve this purpose.
Use these rules to select one of the available xref:time_periods[time periods] as the check period.


[#checkinterval]
=== Setting check intervals

Checks are executed at fixed intervals within state-based monitoring.
{CMK} uses a default of one minute for service checks and 6 seconds for host checks with a Smart Ping.

These defaults can be overridden using the [.guihint]#Normal check interval for service checks# and [.guihint]#Normal check interval for host checks# rule sets:

* Increase to a longer interval to save CPU resources on the {CMK} server and the target system.
* Reduce to a shorter interval to receive notifications faster and collect measured data at a higher resolution.

If you now combine a check period with a check interval, you can ensure that an active check is executed precisely once a day at a very specific time.
For example, if you set the check interval to 24 hours and the check period to 2:00 to 2:01 every day (i.e. only one minute per day), {CMK} will ensure that the check is actually moved to this short time window.

The state of the services will no longer be updated outside of this defined check period and the services will be marked as xref:stale[stale] with the icon:icon_stale[] icon.
With the global setting [.guihint]#Staleness value to mark hosts / services stale# you can define how much time should pass before a host/service goes to _stale_.
This setting can be found under [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > User interface:# 

image::monitoring_basics_staleness.png[alt="Festlegung des Faktors für Staleness."]

This factor represents *n*-times the check interval.
So if your check interval is set to one minute (60 seconds), a service for which there are no new check results will go to _stale_ after 1.5 times the time, i.e. after 90 seconds.


[#max_check_attempts]
=== Modifying check attempts

With the help of the check attempts option you can avoid notifications in the event of sporadic errors.
This makes a check less sensitive, so to speak.
You can use the rule sets [.guihint]#Maximum number of check attempts for host# and [.guihint]#Maximum number of check attempts for service# for this purpose.

If the check attempts are set to 3, for example, and the corresponding service becomes {CRIT}, then initially no notification is triggered.
Only if the next two checks also produce a result that is not {OK}, will the count of the current attempts increase to 3 and the notification will be sent.

A service that is in this intermediate state -- i.e. is not {OK} but has not yet reached the maximum number of check attempts -- will have a _soft state_.
Only a _hard state_ will actually trigger a notification.


== Overview of the most important host and service icons

The following table provides a short overview of the most important icons appearing beside hosts and services:

[cols="5,~"]
|===
|icon:icon_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for services."] |This service is in a scheduled downtime.
|icon:icon_derived_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for hosts."] |This host is in a scheduled downtime.
Services whose host is in a downtime are also marked with this symbol.
|icon:icon_outofnot[] |This host/service is currently outside its notifications period.
|icon:icon_notif_man_disabled[] |Notifications for this host/service are currently disabled.
|icon:icon_disabled[] |Checks for this service are currently disabled.
|icon:icon_stale[] |This state of the host/service is stale.
|icon:icon_flapping[] |This state of the host/service is flapping.
|icon:icon_ack[] |This host/service has an acknowledged problem.
|icon:icon_comment[] |There is a comment for this host/service
|icon:icon_aggr[] |This host/service is a part of a BI aggregation.
|icon:icon_check_parameters[] |Here you can directly-access the settings for the check parameters.
|icon:icon_logwatch[] |Only for logwatch services: here you can access stored log files.
|icon:icon_pnp[] |Here you can access a time series graph of the measured values.
|icon:icon_inventory[] |This host/service has inventory data. A click on it shows the related view.
|icon:icon_crash[] |This check crashed. Click on it to view and submit a crash report.
|===
