:title: Notifications via Jira
:description: You can have {CMK} send notifications to Jira to create and close Jira issues. Find out here how to connect.

{related-start}
xref:notifications#[Notifications]
{related-end}


{cee-only}
If you use the Jira software for project management, software development or for tracking bugs, with the commercial editions you can send notifications from {CMK} to Jira and create _Issues_ there.
This works for the products Jira Work Management (formerly Jira Core), Jira Software and Jira Service Management (formerly Jira Service Desk).

The following options are supported:

* Create issues for host and service problems.
* Create issues with a defined _Priority_.
* Create issues with a defined _Label_.
* Set links to host/services in {CMK} from the generated Jira issues.
* Set a _Resolution_ in the issue when {OK} conditions occur.

To set up the connection between {CMK} and Jira, first create some new _fields_ in Jira and define some Jira-_IDs_.

Next configure the notification method for Jira in {CMK}, entering the Jira IDs that have been created and read.
You will gain more flexibility if you also use xref:wato_user#custom_user_attributes[custom user attributes].
Instead of entering the Jira IDs directly in the notification method, you can define some Jira IDs as custom user attributes.
This makes it easy for individual users to create issues in a variety of JIRA projects.


[#config_jira]
== Configuring Jira

When interacting with Jira, {CMK} needs to know which notifications have already created an issue and which have not.
To make this possible, you need to create two so-called _custom fields_ in Jira -- one for notifications on host issues, and one for service issues.

In order to be able to correctly identify host and service issues, the IDs of these issues must be unique.
This is the case if your Jira instance receives notifications from only a _single_ {CMK} site, as the monitoring core of a {CMK} site ensures uniqueness.
Now, in distributed monitoring, multiple {CMK} sites may send notifications if xref:distributed_monitoring#notifications[decentralized notifications] has been configured.
If your Jira instance receives notifications from multiple {CMK} sites, any uniqueness is most likely over -- at the very latest when the ID from a host issue has already been used by another {CMK} site.
In such a configuration you need another custom field for the {CMK} site with which a unique assignment again becomes possible.

For the configuration in {CMK} you need the Jira IDs of the custom fields you created -- and additionally those of some other fields, so all together the following are required:

* Project ID
* Issue type ID
* Priority ID (optional)
* Host custom field ID
* Service custom field ID
* Site custom field ID (optional)
* (Workflow) Transition ID (optional)

The vast majority of these IDs can be read using the script below via one of Jira's REST APIs.
Jira administrators can also retrieve the IDs via Jira's GUI -- even those IDs that cannot be retrieved via the API and thus the script.


[#jira_custom_fields]
=== Setting up the custom fields in Jira

You can learn how to create custom fields in Jira in the link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/adding-custom-fields-1047552713.html[Jira documentation^], 
including the assignment of the field to the so-called _issue screens_ in Jira.

When creating the fields required for {CMK}, please note the following points regarding the _field type_.
You are free to name your fields as you wish.
However, the field names as shown in the following table match the script with which you can read the Jira IDs in the next section xref:jira_ids_script[Determining Jira IDs using an external script].

[cols="~,~,~",options="header"]
|===
|Custom field |Field type |Name
|Host custom field |`Number field` |`CMK_HOST_FIELD` (example)
|Service custom field |`Number field` |`CMK_SVC_FIELD` (example)
|Site custom field (optional) |`Text field (single line)` |`CMK_SITE_FIELD` (example)
|===

Also make sure that the Jira user used by {CMK} to create issues, i.e. entered in the xref:config_cmk[{CMK} notification rule], has read _and write_ access to these custom fields.


[#jira_ids_script]
=== Determining Jira IDs using an external script

You can query the IDs collectively with the following script, which uses the link:https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/latest[Jira REST API^].

Replace `JIRA_USERNAME`, `JIRA_PASSWORD`, `PROJECT_KEY` and `\https://jira.server.your-domain.de` with your applicable values.
You can also determine the `PROJECT_KEY` from the Jira GUI without requiring administrator rights.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use a Jira Cloud product, the script is not authenticated with a password, but instead with an API token.
Background information and instructions for creating an API token can be found in the link:https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/[Jira documentation.^] 
In Jira, you can copy the generated API token to the clipboard and paste it into the following script as `JIRA_PASSWORD`.

[#jira_ids_gui]
=== Determining Jira IDs using the GUI

As an alternative to executing scripts, you can also read out the IDs via the Jira GUI, but for this you need to log in to Jira with an administrator account.
Atlassian, the manufacturer of Jira, has described this procedure using the example of the Project ID in its own link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-get-project-id-from-the-jira-user-interface-827341414.html[instructions^].

The IDs of the other fields and types of issues can be read by editing the respective element in the Jira Administrator GUI.
The ID is then usually the last value in your browser's address bar.


[#config_cmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

To use the Jira notifications, proceed as follows in {CMK}:

. If you want to use xref:wato_user#custom_user_attributes[custom user attributes], you can create them for the following Jira IDs:
Project ID (`jiraproject`), Issue type ID (`jiraissuetype`), Priority ID (`jirapriority`) and Transition ID (`jiraresolution`).
The names that you enter as the [.guihint]#Name# of an attribute are shown in brackets.
You create a user custom attribute with [.guihint]#Setup > Users > Custom user attributes > Add attribute#: +
+
image::jira_notification_custom_user_attribute.png[alt="A custom attribute for the Jira Project ID."]
+

Make sure that the checkbox [.guihint]#Make this variable available in notifications# is set for all these custom user attributes created for Jira. +
In the properties of a user, you can then enter in these attributes the Jira IDs for which this user is responsible. +
For each custom user attribute, leave the field of the associated Jira ID _empty_ in the notification rule that is created in the following steps.
These fields are then filled with the custom user attributes.

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#JIRA (Commercial editions only#:
+
image::jira_notification_rule.png[alt="The notification method settings for Jira."]
+
. In the [.guihint]#JIRA URL# field, enter the URL of your Jira instance, e.g. `jira.server.your-domain.com`.

. In [.guihint]#User Name# and [.guihint]#Password# you store the Jira account's data for this access.

. For [.guihint]#Project ID# and [.guihint]#Issue type ID# you need the previously-identified IDs in Jira, in the example '10401' for the Project ID and '10006' for the Issue type 'Bug'.

. For [.guihint]#Host custom field ID#, [.guihint]#Service custom field ID# and (optionally) [.guihint]#Site custom field ID# enter the IDs of the custom fields you created in Jira.

. To be able to link directly to {CMK} from any generated issues, under [.guihint]#Monitoring URL# enter the URL for your {CMK} site, for example: `\https://mycmkserver/mysite`

Furthermore, you also have the following optional settings:

* With the [.guihint]#Priority ID# you can define with which priority the issues are created in Jira. Here you can enter one of the 'priority types' read out in the script, from '1' to '5'.

* You can change the descriptions that are created for host and service problems in the issues via the options [.guihint]#Summary for host notifications# and [.guihint]#Summary for service notifications#.

* You can use the [.guihint]#Label# option to define whether you want to pass labels when creating issues in Jira. If you activate Label without entering a value, `monitoring` will be set. +
{CMK} writes the value of the label into the Jira `labels` field, that only works if this field exists in your Jira application, which is the case with _Jira Software_, but not with _Jira Service Desk_ for example.

* If you also want to have a [.guihint]#Resolution# entered into the issue in Jira when notifying of a state change to {OK} in {CMK}, you can define it under [.guihint]#Activate resolution with following resolution transition ID#. +
To be able to determine the correct ID here, you also need administrator rights in Jira. Navigate back to the [.guihint]#Issues# area and click on [.guihint]#Workflows#. Then click on [.guihint]#View# in the row of the standard workflow of the Jira project you are using. If you now see a flowchart, change the display by clicking on [.guihint]#Text#. You will be able to read the desired ID in the [.guihint]#Transitions (id)# column.

* With [.guihint]#Set optional timeout for connections to JIRA# you can configure the timeout for connections to Jira. If you do not enter anything here, the default value of 10 seconds will apply.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following points:

include::include_ticketsystem.asciidoc[]

. The topic of contact selection is somewhat different when using custom user attributes, as this is intended to assign different Jira IDs to different users.
Therefore, in this case you will usually want to inform _several_ contacts, namely those users to whom you have assigned the custom attributes.
If these users use different Jira IDs, identical notifications will not be generated.

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notifications#notification_testing[notifications].


[#diagnosis]
== Diagnostic options

If no tickets arrive in Jira after setting up the notification rule in {CMK}, check the associated log file `~/var/log/notify.log`. 
Jira usually returns quite useful error messages here, which can actually help you with the problem diagnosis. 
In the following we list some examples.


[discrete]
=== Error message: Unable to create issue, JIRA response code 400, Field 'labels' cannot be set.

Your Jira product may not have labels. 
Simply disable the use of labels in your notification rule in {CMK} by unchecking [.guihint]#Label#.


[discrete]
=== Error message: Unable to create issue, JIRA response code 400, b'project is required'.

This error message indicates that the ID you entered in the notification rule for the field in question (here: Project ID) is incorrect.


[discrete]
=== Error message: Unable to resolve \https://jira.server.your-domain.de/browse/ISSUE-123, JIRA response code 500, b'Internal server error'.

If you get this error message when a ticket in Jira is supposed to be closed automatically by {CMK}, or respectively should be changed to another status, then this *may* be a hint that the Transition ID you entered is not correct.
The Transition ID is in the notification rule in the [.guihint]#Activate resolution with following resolution transition ID# field.
As a rule, you should compare this ID again with the Jira web interface.
