Monitoring OpenShift clusters with {CE} (SaaS) requires to enable access to the ports of the Kubernetes API from the Internet.
For security reasons, we recommend restricting this access to the IP address of the {CMK} server.

There is already a separate xref:monitoring_kubernetes#[Monitoring Kubernetes] article describing the setting up of a monitoring of Kubernetes and its various flavors.
However, since OpenShift in general and in particular its setup work a bit differently, we have decided to create a separate article for describing the setting up of an OpenShift monitoring and respectively the Kubernetes clusters running in it.
In the rest of this article, we will refer to these same clusters -- for readability and simplicity -- as OpenShift clusters.
ifdef::onprem[]
Monitoring OpenShift clusters is only possible with one of the {CMK} commercial editions.
endif::[]

== Introduction

{CMK} helps you to monitor your OpenShift clusters.
ifdef::onprem[]
Starting with version {v23}, you can use any of our commercial editions to monitor the following objects:
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
With {CE} (SaaS), you can monitor the following objects:
endif::[]

* Clusters
* Deployments
* Nodes
* Pods
* DaemonSets
* StatefulSets
* CronJobs

For a complete listing of all of the available check plug-ins for the monitoring of Kubernetes, see our link:https://checkmk.com/integrations?distributions%5B%5D=check_mk&distributions%5B%5D=check_mk_cloud&search=kube_[Catalog of check plug-ins^].


ifdef::onprem[]
=== Setting up the monitoring environment

Since OpenShift clusters can also undergo major changes very quickly in terms of the number and location of individual components, we recommend creating a separate {CMK} site for monitoring an OpenShift environment.
This can then be connected to the central site as usual via the xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring] procedure.
endif::[]


=== The process of monitoring OpenShift in {CMK}

{CMK} monitors your OpenShift clusters in two ways:

* {CMK} fetches basic information directly from your cluster via the Kubernetes API.
This can already be used to retrieve the states of nodes and containers. Most metadata from your pods and deployments is also obtained in this way.
For a comprehensive monitoring, however, something is still missing up to this point.
The questions of how much load, for example, a particular deployment is generating on the CPU, or how much memory a DaemonSet is currently tying up, cannot be answered with this method.
* Since Prometheus is already installed by default in OpenShift clusters, {CMK} can query exactly this Prometheus instance within your OpenShift environment and prepare the resulting data for you in the usual {CMK} manner.
For a fully comprehensive monitoring of your OpenShift environment, we strongly recommend setting up this connection.
Additionally, using the xref:dashboards[Kubernetes dashboards] is only useful if the appropriate workload data is available.


== Creating prerequisites in the cluster

To be able to monitor the OpenShift environment in {CMK}, first create the prerequisites in your cluster.


=== Create a namespace and service account

First, you need to set up a namespace and service account for {CMK} in your OpenShift cluster.
The quickest way to do this is via the OpenShift CLI (`oc` for short).

In the following example, we will name this namespace `checkmk-monitoring`.
If you want or need to choose a different name, you will also need to make this change when creating the service account.

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} oc create namespace checkmk-monitoring
namespace/checkmk-monitoring created
----

The service account with its associated role and the so-called RoleBinding can be created by specifying our ready-made link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk_kube_agent/blob/checkmk_docs/deploy/kubernetes/checkmk-serviceaccount.yaml[YAML file published on GitHub^].
Check its contents and then run the following command:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-user} oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmk/checkmk_kube_agent/checkmk_docs/deploy/kubernetes/checkmk-serviceaccount.yaml
serviceaccount/checkmk created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/checkmk-metrics-reader created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/checkmk-metrics-reader-binding created
----

Alternatively, you can first download this YAML file, customize it according to your needs, and then apply `oc apply -f` to this local copy of the file.


=== Obtain API endpoints, token and certificate

With the `oc` command line tool you can now also read out all of the information from your cluster, which you will usually have to specify to set up the special agent.
If you have changed the service account name or namespace, you must edit this information as described for the following commands.


[#get_kubernetes_endpoint]
==== Retrieve the Kubernetes API endpoint

The Kubernetes API endpoint is displayed by `oc` with the following command:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-user} oc cluster-info
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://api.myopenshift.example.com:6443
----

This address, including the specified port, will later be included in the [.guihint]#API server connection > Endpoint# field in the xref:rule[Kubernetes rule].


[#get_prometheus_endpoint]
==== Retrieve the Prometheus API endpoint

Obtaining the address from the Prometheus instance's API endpoint in your cluster may be easier via OpenShift's GUI.
In the administrator role, you can find a more or less long list via [.guihint]#Networking > Routes#.
Here you should also find a route that probably has the word Prometheus in its name.
This also simply depends on the configuration of your OpenShift cluster.
Under Location you will then find the very URL which you will later require for the [.guihint]#Prometheus API endpoint# field.

You may also be able to get the FQDN on the command line with the following command.

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep prometheus
openshift-monitoring    prometheus-k8s   prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.myopenshift.example.com   prometheus-k8s  web  reencrypt/Redirect   None
----

You will then only need to later prefix the protocol to the `prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.myopenshift.example.com` string in the [.guihint]#Prometheus API endpoint# field within the xref:rule[Kubernetes rule].


[#get_token]
==== Retrieve the token

The following command can be used to read out the token, which is usually the one you will later need to specify for the special agent in {CMK}:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} oc get secret $(oc describe sa checkmk -n checkmk-monitoring | grep 'Tokens' | awk '{ print $2 }') -n checkmk-monitoring -o=jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IkxFbDdZb25t...
----

Leave the shell open with this information or copy the token to a location that you can access during the following setup in {CMK}.


[#get_certificate]
==== Retrieve the certificate

The following command can be used to retrieve the certificate which you will later need to specify under [.guihint]#Global settings# in {CMK}.

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} oc get secret $(oc describe sa checkmk -n checkmk-monitoring | grep 'Tokens' | awk '{ print $2 }') -n checkmk-monitoring -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
----

Leave the shell open with this information, or copy the certificate -- including the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` lines -- to a location that you can access during the following setup in {CMK}.

If the output here is empty, the same tip applies as in the preceding xref:get_token[Retrieve the token] section.


[#setupincheckmk]
== Setting up the monitoring in {CMK}

Next, in the {CMK} GUI, we move on to setting up the xref:glossar#special_agent[special agent] and a rule for automatically creating hosts for your Kubernetes objects.
However, to set up the special agent, first there are a few prerequisites that will need to be met:


[#token]
=== Storing the password (token) in {CMK}

It is best to store the xref:get_token[service account's password (token)] in the {CMK} password store.
This is the safest option, since you can separate the storage and use of the password in an organized way.
Alternatively, enter the password directly in plain text when creating the rule (see below).

To add the password to the {CMK} password store, navigate to [.guihint]#Setup > General > Passwords > Add password#.
We use `My OpenShift Token` as the ID and title in our example:

image::kubernetes_password.png[]


[#certimport]
=== Importing a service account’s CA certificate into {CMK}

In order for {CMK} to trust the xref:get_certificate[service account's certificate chain], you will need to store it in {CMK}.
Copy everything here -- including the lines containing `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` -- and add the certificate in the Setup menu under [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > Site management > Trusted certificate authorities for SSL#:

image::kubernetes_ca.png[]


[#source-host]
=== Creating the piggyback host

Create a new host in {CMK} in the usual way and name it `myopenshiftclusterhost` for example.
As the title and host name suggest, this host is used to collect the xref:glossar#piggyback[piggyback] data and also to map all services and metrics at the cluster level.
Since this host receives data exclusively through the special agent, in the host's properties be sure to set the [.guihint]#IP address family# option to [.guihint]#No IP#.
Confirm this whole configuration by pressing the [.guihint]#Save & view folder# button.

image::monitoring_openshift_add_host_no_ip.png[alt="Example setup for a cluster host with the important 'No IP' setting."]


=== Setting up dynamic host management

To ensure separation between objects in different Kubernetes clusters, it is usually convenient to create a folder per cluster via [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Add folder#, in which the xref:dcd#[dynamic host management] can create all of a cluster's hosts automatically.
However, creating and using such a folder is optional.

Next, set up a connection for the incoming piggyback data.
To do this, navigate to [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Dynamic host management > Add connection.#
First enter a title and then under [.guihint]#Connection Properties# click [.guihint]#show more#.

The next very important step is to enter the previously created xref:source-host[piggyback host] under [.guihint]#Restrict source hosts#.

Then, under [.guihint]#Piggyback creation options# click [.guihint]#Add new element# and under [.guihint]#Create hosts in# select the previously created folder.

You can leave the default attributes under [.guihint]#Host attributes to set# as they are.
These ensure that {CMK} only accepts the piggyback data from the automatically created hosts and does not attempt to ping these or access them via SNMP, for example.

In an OpenShift environment where monitorable and monitored objects continuously come and go, it is usually recommended to also enable the [.guihint]#Automatically delete hosts without piggyback data# option.
What exactly this option does and under which circumstances hosts are then actually deleted is explained in the xref:dcd#automatic_deletion_of_hosts[automatic deletion of hosts] chapter in the article on dynamic host management.

Finally, enable the [.guihint]#Discover services during creation# option.

The [.guihint]#Connection Properties# section of this new connection might look like the following:

image::monitoring_openshift_connection_properties.png[alt="Example settings for a dynamic host management."]


=== Customizing the periodic service discovery

By default, {CMK} performs a service discovery every two hours and displays the result from this discovery in the [.guihint]#Check_MK Discovery# service.
You can find this setting in the [.guihint]#Periodic service discovery# rule set.
In the context of OpenShift, we recommend creating a rule with the label `cmk/kubernetes:yes` for all hosts.
This is because every host representing Kubernetes objects automatically receives this label from {CMK}.
In this case you should choose a shorter interval than two hours for the service discovery, and also activate the [.guihint]#Automatically update service configuration# option.
The settings in the below screenshot are only examples.
You will need to decide what makes sense for your clusters on a case-by-case basis.

image::monitoring_kubernetes_periodic_service_discovery.png[alt="An example setup for the periodic service discovery for Kubernetes objects."]

To restrict this rule to all hosts in your cluster,  under [.guihint]#Host labels# simply enter `cmk/kubernetes:yes` in the [.guihint]#Conditions#.
However, if you also want to create different rules for different clusters, just use the respective cluster-specific label here.
These labels are always in the form `cmk/kubernetes/cluster:mycluster`.

image::monitoring_kubernetes_periodic_service_discovery_conditions.png[alt="Example a restriction to hosts using a cluster-specific label."]


[#rule]
=== Setting up the special agent

Now that all prerequisites have been created in the cluster and in {CMK}, you can turn your attention to the special agent configuration.
This can be found via [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > VM, cloud, container > Kubernetes#.
Create a new rule with [.guihint]#Add rule#.

First of all, you must assign a name for the cluster to be monitored.
This name can be specified freely as desired.
It is used to assign a unique name to all objects that originate from this specific cluster.
For example, if you enter `mycluster` here, the names of the hosts for all of the pods in this cluster will later begin with `pod_mycluster`.
The next part of the host name will then always be the namespace in which this Kubernetes object exists.
For example, the host name of a pod could then be `pod_mycluster_kube-system_svclb-traefik-8bgw7`.

Under [.guihint]#Token#, now select the xref:token[previously created entry] from the {CMK} password store.

image::monitoring_openshift_cluster_name_and_token.png[alt="Sample cluster name and token selection."]

Under [.guihint]#API server connection > Endpoint#, {CMK} now requires you to enter the URL through which your Kubernetes API server can be contacted.
The port is only required if the service is not provided via a virtual host.
Here, enter the address that you determined in the xref:get_kubernetes_endpoint[Retrieve the Kubernetes API endpoint] section.

If you have so far followed these instructions step by step and have -- xref:certimport[as described above] -- deposited your cluster's CA certificate in {CMK}, then under [.guihint]#SSL certificate verification# select [.guihint]#Verify the certificate#.

image::monitoring_openshift_rule_api_server_connection.png[alt="Example for specifying the API server connection."]

Enable the [.guihint]#Enrich with usage data# option, select [.guihint]#Use data from OpenShift# in the following menu, and enter the [.guihint]#Prometheus API endpoint# that you determined in the xref:get_prometheus_endpoint[Retrieve the Prometheus API endpoint] section.

image::monitoring_openshift_rule_enrich.png[alt="Example of specifying the cluster collector connection."]

The list under [.guihint]#Collect information about...#  allows you to select which objects within your cluster should be monitored.
This list covers the most relevant objects.
If you also decide to monitor the [.guihint]#Pods of CronJobs#, please refer to the xref:user_interface#inline_help[inline help] for this option.

image::monitoring_openshift_rule_collect_info_about.png[alt="Example list of a selection of Kubernetes objects that are to be monitored."]

The next two selections allow you to further narrow down the objects to be monitored.
If you are only interested in the objects from certain namespaces, set this accordingly under [.guihint]#Monitor namespaces#.
Here you can either enter individual namespaces to be monitored or explicitly exclude individual namespaces from monitoring.

The [.guihint]#Cluster resource aggregation# option allows you to designate nodes that do not provide resources for your cluster's workload.
These nodes should be excluded from the calculation of available resources.
Otherwise, there is a risk that capacity bottlenecks will not be detected.
We therefore by default exclude the `control-plane` and `infra` nodes from the calculation.

image::monitoring_openshift_namespaces_and_resource_aggregation.png[alt="Example configuration for namespaces and resource aggregation."]

As a final option, you can import so-called _annotations_ from Kubernetes.
In {CMK}, these annotations become xref:glossar#label[host labels] and can thus be further used as conditions in rules.
Use regular expressions to specify which annotations should be imported.
Consult the detailed inline help again at this point.

*Note:* The [.guihint]#Import all valid annotations# option is provided here only for completeness.
We do not recommend importing _all_ annotations at once, because this can create a very large mountain of useless labels in {CMK}.

*Important:* Under [.guihint]#Conditions > Explicit hosts# *you must* now enter the xref:source-host[previously created host]:

image::monitoring_openshift_explicit_hosts.png[alt="Rules for special agents must always be explicitly set to specific hosts, as seen here."]

Then save the rule and perform a service discovery for this host.
The first cluster-level services will appear right away here:

image::monitoring_openshift_service_discovery.png[alt="Example view of the first service discovery after completing the configuration."]

Now activate all of the changes you have made and let the dynamic host management do the work from now on.
This will generate all of the hosts for your Kubernetes objects within a short period of time.


== Labels for Kubernetes objects

{CMK} automatically generates labels for objects such as clusters, deployments, or namespaces during a service discovery.
All labels for these objects that {CMK} automatically generates start with `cmk/kubernetes/`.
For example, a pod will always get a label from the node (`cmk/kubernetes/node:mynode`), a label that identifies the object as a pod (`cmk/kubernetes/object:pod`) and a label for the namespace (`cmk/kubernetes/namespace:mynamespace`).
This makes it very easy to create filters and rules for all objects of the same type or in the same namespace.


== Dashboards and views

[#dashboards]
=== Kubernetes dashboards

ifdef::onprem[]
{cee-only}
The {CMK} commercial editions are supplied with six built-in dashboards for Kubernetes.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
{CE} (SaaS) is supplied with six built-in dashboards for Kubernetes.
endif::[]
In order to make sense of these dashboards, it is necessary to have our Cluster Collector installed and configured.
Specifically, these dashboards are called:

* Kubernetes (Overview)
* Kubernetes Cluster
* Kubernetes DaemonSet
* Kubernetes Deployment
* Kubernetes Namespace
* Kubernetes StatefulSet

The entry point is always the [.guihint]#Kubernetes# dashboard, which you can access via [.guihint]#Monitor > Applications > Kubernetes#:

image::monitoring_kubernetes_kubernetes_dashboard.png[alt="Example of the overview dashboard."]

In the [.guihint]#Kubernetes# dashboard, all of your monitored clusters are listed on the left side.
This listing of clusters is also your entry point for drilling deeper into the dashboards.
Clicking on the name of a cluster will take you to the [.guihint]#Kubernetes Cluster# dashboard for the selected cluster.
In the [.guihint]#Kubernetes Cluster# dashboard, clicking on the respective name then takes you to the other context-dependent dashboards:

image::monitoring_kubernetes_cluster_dashboard.png[alt="Detail of the cluster dashboard with paths to the other dashboards."]


=== The HW/SW inventory

Monitoring OpenShift with {CMK} also supports xref:inventory#[HW/SW inventory].
For example, in the cluster dashboard above, clicking on the cluster's ID name (here: [.guihint]#mycluster#) will take you to the cluster's inventory.

In the same way, i.e. in the other dashboards via the boxes with the ID names of the objects, the inventory for each respective object can be displayed.
The following example shows the HW/SW inventory for a pod:

image::kubernetes_monitoring_hw_sw_inventory.png[width=88% alt="Example of a view of the HW/SW inventory for a pod"]


== Checking the installation

In the {CMK} GUI you can verify that an installation and configuration have been successful.

The most important services here are definitely the [.guihint]#Kubernetes API# and [.guihint]#Cluster collector#.
These must be present on the cluster host you have created and should also display specific, real information.

image::monitoring_openshift_check_installation.png[alt="The most important services to check for a correct installation."]

Under [.guihint]#Summary# the [.guihint]#Kubernetes API# service should normally report [.guihint]#Live, Ready#, and if the Cluster collector is set up, it will ideally show [.guihint]#Successfully queried usage data from Prometheus#.

In the [.guihint]#Kubernetes# dashboard, you can determine very early on if the Cluster collector is running and collecting data in a cluster.
If set up correctly, the [.guihint]#Kubernetes# dashboard should look something like this:

image::monitoring_openshift_validation_dashboard.png[alt="Kubernetes dashboard with data for CPU and memory resources."]

If you now click on the cluster name here, you will land in the [.guihint]#Kubernetes Cluster# dashboard for the respective cluster.
Here the three boxes [.guihint]#Primary datasource#, [.guihint]#Cluster collector# and [.guihint]#API health# should be green and show [.guihint]#OK#.

image::monitoring_kubernetes_cluster_state.png[alt="A correctly-functioning cluster monitoring."]


== Removing monitoring components from OpenShift

=== Deleting the service account

If you have used our default YAML file to create the service account, you can also delete it as follows:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-user} oc delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmk/checkmk_kube_agent/checkmk_docs/deploy/kubernetes/checkmk-serviceaccount.yaml
serviceaccount "checkmk" deleted
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "checkmk-metrics-reader" deleted
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "checkmk-metrics-reader-binding" deleted
----


=== Removing the namespace, when required

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} oc delete namespace checkmk-monitoring
namespace "checkmk-monitoring" deleted
----
