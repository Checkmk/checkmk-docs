== Configuring ServiceNow

A special configuration within ServiceNow is not required, only the instance URL (possibly in the form of a custom URL) and user data must be known.
The user must have the role _itil_ in ServiceNow.


[#config_checkmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

To connect ServiceNow, now proceed as follows in {CMK}:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Servicenow (Enterprise only)#.
. For the [.guihint]#ServiceNow URL# enter your instance URL.
. Add the user name and password of the _creating_ user.
. Select the [.guihint]#Management type#: ServiceNow has two types, _case_ and _incident_.
Depending on your selection, the options displayed below will change.
Each of the options offered in {CMK}, both for the _case_ type and the _incident_ type corresponds to the setting of the same name in ServiceNow.


=== Setting up the _Case_ management type

If you have selected [.guihint]#Case#, you can set various other options to shape the content of the notification.

=== Setting up the _Incident_ management type

If you have selected [.guihint]#Incident#, there are a couple of notable specifics on how a notification is laid out.

. Under [.guihint]#Caller ID# add the user name of the _concerned_ user.
It is recommended to use the _same_ user name for _both_ the creating _and_ the receiving user.
See the {CMK} inline help for more detailed information.
. Again, all other options are used to define the content of the notification.
. For the two ServiceNow-specific options [.guihint]#Urgency# and [.guihint]#Impact#, in the {CMK} inline help you can find links to the respective entries in the ServiceNow documentation.


=== Selecting a contact

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:
