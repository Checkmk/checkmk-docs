== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

To connect ServiceNow, now proceed as follows in {CMK}:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Servicenow (Enterprise only)#.
. For the [.guihint]#ServiceNow URL# enter your instance URL.
. Add the user name and password of the _creating_ user.
. Select the [.guihint]#Management type#: ServiceNow has two types, _case_ and _incident_.
Depending on your selection, the options displayed below will change.
Each of the options offered in {CMK}, both for the _case_ type and the _incident_ type corresponds to the setting of the same name in ServiceNow.


=== Setting up the _Case_ management type

If you have selected [.guihint]#Case#, you can set various other options to shape the content of the notification.
