== Why bother to create your own checks?

Thanks to the large number of check plug-ins supplied as standard, {CMK} can already monitor a great deal of relevant data.
Nevertheless, every IT environment is unique, so that very individual requirements often arise.
With the _local checks_, you are able to create your own services quickly and easily by making small extensions to the agent on the target host.

These local plug-ins differ from other checks in one important respect:
Their state is determined directly on the host on which the data is being retrieved.

ifdef::onprem[]
This eliminates the need to create checks using Python, and you are completely free to choose the scripting language.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
A major advantage of local checks is that no plug-in needs to be installed on the {CMK} site, and only a search for services is required.
Local checks are therefore very suitable for very tightly-managed {CMK} installations and {CE} (SaaS).
endif::[]
Local checks also give _server admins_ a great deal of freedom.
_Monitoring admins_ only have to decide _whether_ to include new local checks as services.

[TIP]
====
You can combine the mechanism provided by local checks with all of the methods supported by Checkmk for transporting agent data:
ifdef::onprem[]
xref:datasource_programs#[data source programs], xref:devel_special_agents#[special agents], 
endif::[]
xref:piggyback#[piggyback data] and xref:spool_directory#[spool files].
The data from all sources is merged, but conflicts will occur if the service name is (inadvertently) assigned twice
-- for this reason, make sure that each service names are unique.
====


[#simple_check]
== Writing a simple local check

[#syntax]
=== Creating the script

A local check can be written in any programming language supported by the target host.
The script must be constructed so that each check produces a state line consisting of four parts.
Here is an example:

[{shell}]
----
0 "My service" myvalue=73 My output text which may contain spaces
----

The four parts are separated by blanks and have the following meanings:

[cols="25,20,~",options="header"]
|===
|Example value |Meaning |Description
|`0` |State |The state of the service is given as a number: `0` for {OK}, `1` for {WARN}, `2` for {CRIT} and `3` for {UNKNOWN}.
Alternatively, the state can also be xref:dynamic_state[calculated dynamically]: then the number is replaced by a `P`.

|`"My service"` |Service name |The service name as shown in {CMK}, in the output of the check in double quotes.

|`myvalue=73;65;75` |Value and metrics |Metric values for the data.
More information about the construction can be found in the chapter on xref:metrics[metrics].
Alternatively a minus sign can be coded if the check produces no metrics.

|`My output text which may contain spaces` |State detail |Details for the state as they will be shown in {CMK} in the [.guihint]#Summary# field.
This part can also contain blanks.
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
// MFS: FIXME, kann in 2.5.0 wieder vereinfacht werden
Up to {CMK} {v24}p4 there must always be *exactly one space* (ASCII `0x20`) between the four parts of this output.
Starting with link:https://checkmk.com/werk/18107[{v24}p5^] multiple spaces are allowed.
Within the state details, any number of any type of spaces can be used.
Deviations from the specification just described _may_ work, but are not _guaranteed_ to do so.
Until {CMK} {v24}p4 lines that cannot be parsed will simply be ignored.
With {v24}p5 and up, a service with the state {CRIT} and details regarding the problems found will be created.
// Abweichungen von der soeben beschriebenen Spezifikation _können_ funktionieren, _müssen_ es aber nicht.
// Bis {CMK} {v24}p4 werden Zeilen, die nicht gelesen werden können, verworfen. Ab {v24}p5 wird ein Dienst mit Status {CRIT} und Details zu den gefundenen Problemen erzeugt.
// Künftige Versionen von {CMK} werden dieses Ausgabeformat möglicherweise erzwingen und abweichende lokale Checks ignorieren.
====

If you are unsure about a possible output, you can simply test it by writing a small script with the `echo` command.
Insert the output you want to test into the `echo` command.
Our example uses double quotation marks on the outside, as variables inside (environment variables and those set in the script) are evaluated.
As a result, you must enclose the quotation marks for the service name with `\` so that these characters are not interpreted by the shell as the end and beginning of a string (and thus removed from the output):

.mylocalcheck
[{bash}]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "0 \"My 1st service\" - This static service is always OK"
----

For Windows hosts, such a script will look very similar to this:

.mylocalcheck.bat
[source, winbatch]
----
@echo off
echo 0 "My 1st service" - This static service is always OK
----

Both scripts produce the same result in the output:

[{shell}]
----
0 "My 1st service" - This static service is always OK
----

For {CMK} only this output is relevant, not how you created this output.

By the way -- you can write any number of outputs in a script.
Each output line will have its own service created in {CMK}.
Therefore, no newline characters are allowed in the output -- unless they are masked, for example for a xref:multi-line[multi-line output] in {CMK}.

How it can be checked whether the local script will be correctly invoked by the agent can be seen in the xref:diagnose[Error analysis].

include::include_special_chars.asciidoc[]


[#distribute]
=== Distributing the script

Once the script has been written it can be distributed to the appropriate hosts.
The path used will depend on the operating system.
A list of path names can be found in xref:folders_script[Files and directories] below.

Don't forget to make the script executable on Unix-like systems.
The path shown in this example is for Linux (agent package with default settings):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod +x /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
----

ifdef::onprem[]
If you use the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery], the script can be distributed with a rule-based procedure.
More on rule-creation can be found in the chapter xref:bakery[Distribution via the Agent Bakery].
endif::[]


[#add_service]
=== Adding the service to the monitoring

At every invocation of the {CMK} agent the local check contained in the script will also be executed and appended to the agent's output.
The xref:glossar#service_discovery[service discovery] also functions automatically like with other services:

image::localchecks_services.png[alt="The local check found by the service discovery."]

Once the service has been added to the monitoring and the changes have been activated, the implementation of the self-created service with the aid of a local check will be complete.
Should a problem arise during the service discovery, the xref:diagnose[Error analysis] can be of help.


[#metrics]
== Metrics

[#metrics_intro]
=== Defining metrics

You can also define metrics in a local check.
The shortest possible syntax for metrics data is:

[{shell}]
----
metricname=value
----

where `value` is the current value.

The full syntax for metric data is:

[{shell}]
----
metricname=value;warn;crit;min;max
----

Here, `warn` and `crit` define the (upper) threshold values.
In order for these threshold values to be displayed in the graph, xref:dynamic_state[dynamic calculation] must be activated (state `P`).
The state is then calculated using {CMK}.
The last parameters specified for `min` and `max` fix the value range.

A complete example could therefore look like this:

[{shell}]
----
count=73;80;90;0;100
----

The values are separated by semicolons.
If a value is not required, the field remains empty or is omitted at the end, as in the following for `warn`, `crit` and `max`:

[{shell}]
----
count=42;;;0
----

[TIP]
====
ifdef::onprem[]
In the commercial editions
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
In {CE}
endif::[]
the values for `min` and `max` can be defined -- but only for compatibility reasons.
Limiting the associated graph to a specific value range has no effect in
ifdef::onprem[]
the commercial editions.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
{CE}.
endif::[]
====


[#metricname]
=== Names and units used by metrics

Metric definitions for local checks are no different from metric definitions for other types of checks.
Ultimately, you have
ifdef::onprem[]
three
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
two
endif::[]
options for assigning units and easy-to-understand names to metrics:

* You access existing metric definitions that 'fit' the required purpose.
* You create your own metrics _ad-hoc_ and uniquely -- this is often sufficient for pure counters.
ifdef::onprem[]
* You create your own metrics and store a metric definition -- this gives you the greatest flexibility.
endif::[]


[#metrics_reuse]
==== Using existing metric definitions

The easiest way to get suitable units, an automatically adjusted legend and often a Perf-O-Meter is to use existing metric definitions.
In this article, some examples use the identifiers `humidity` or `temperature`.
Predefined metric definitions exist for both (link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/blob/{current-major}/cmk/plugins/collection/graphing/humidity.py[humidity^] and link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/blob/{current-major}/cmk/plugins/collection/graphing/temperature.py[temperature^]), which provide the metrics with the correct units.
In both cases, the metric definition provides a Perf-O-Meter and the legends of the graphs then show _degrees Celsius_ and _relative humidity in percent_.

ifdef::onprem[]
The most important supplied metric definitions can be found in `~/lib/python3/cmk/plugins/collection/graphing` (link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/tree/{current-major}/cmk/plugins/collection/graphing[GitHub^]), others at `~/lib/python3/cmk/plugins/*/graphing` (link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/tree/{current-major}/cmk/plugins/[GitHub^]) and the units used in `~/lib/python3/cmk/gui/plugins/metrics/unit.py` (link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/blob/{current-major}/cmk/gui/plugins/metrics/unit.py[GitHub^]).
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
The most important supplied metric definitions can be found in the link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/tree/{current-major}/cmk/plugins/collection/graphing[_graphing collection_ on GitHub^], more specific ones in the respective link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/tree/{current-major}/cmk/plugins/[folders under _graphing_ on GitHub^] and the units used in the file link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/blob/{current-major}/cmk/gui/plugins/metrics/unit.py[`unit.py` on GitHub^].
endif::[]
The search for exactly matching metric definitions is often worthwhile, as {CMK} also provides combined graphs for related metrics.


[#metrics_adhoc]
==== Defining metrics ad-hoc

In the first examples shown in this article for the metrics we used names such as `myvalue`, `count` or `metricname`.
Without a suitable metric definition, these are given an initial capital letter in the legend of the graph and underscores are replaced by spaces.
Thus, `outgoing_queue_size` becomes the easily readable [.guihint]#Outgoing queue size#.
Since a pure counter does not require a unit, the sensibly selected identifier already fulfills its purpose here without the need for an additional metric definition.
If units are actually required, you may need to include them in the name.

It becomes problematic if the attempt to define a metric ad-hoc inadvertently has the effect explained in the last section and assigns an existing metric definition.
Maximum confusion can occur especially when units do not match, for example, a supplied metric uses a percentage scale with floating point numbers between 0 and 100{nbsp}%, but the value range of your local check provides an open-ended number as a fixed point number.
Or you have a queue for current requests (_Current requests queue_), which you simply want to call `current` - the result would be the assignment of the metric definition for link:https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/blob/2.4.0/cmk/plugins/collection/graphing/current.py[amperage^].

So, `current_requests_queue` would be a much better choice here.
You can be completely safe with an additional prefix -- for example: `mycompany_current_requests_queue`.


ifdef::onprem[]
[#metrics_custom]
==== Writing your own metric definitions

If you have special requirements, for example you need graphs with a legend and a Perf-O-Meter, you will need your own metric definitions.
Read the chapter on metrics xref:devel_check_plugins#metrics_advanced[in the article on programming agent-based check plug-ins]
endif::[]


[#multiple_metrics]
=== Multiple metrics

You can also output multiple metrics.
In the definitions these are separated by the 'pipe' character (`|`), for example like this:

[{shell}]
----
count1=42|count2=23
----

On Windows hosts you must prefix these pipes in the script with a circumflex (`^`) so that these pipes also appear in the output:

.mylocalcheck.bat
[source, winbatch]
----
@echo off
echo 0 "My 2nd service" count1=42^|count2=23 A service with 2 graphs
----

A complete output with two metrics will then look something like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
0 "My 2nd service" count1=42|count2=23 A service with 2 graphs
----

Once you have also added the new service to the monitoring, in the service list you will see the text for the state detail in the [.guihint]#Summary# field.
Clicking on the service will display the page with its service details.
The metrics are shown in the [.guihint]#Details# field, and below that you will see the service graphs that are automatically generated by {CMK}:

image::localchecks_graphs2.png[alt="The service details with the two graphs."]

[TIP]
====
This example uses an evaluation on the host (`0`, `1` or `2`) instead of xref:dynamic_state[dynamic calculation] (`P`).
Any additional threshold values passed would be ignored here in the graph.
====


[#dynamic_state]
=== Dynamically calculating the state

In the previous sections, you learned how to provide values for metrics and use these to generate graphs.
The logical next step is now to use additionally passed threshold values for a dynamic calculation of the service state.
This is exactly what {CMK} enables in order to make the preparation of the data received consistent with many of the states generated via plug-ins.

If in the first field of the output, which determines the state, you pass the letter `P` instead of a number, the service state will be calculated based on the threshold values that are passed.
In addition to the actual value, the transferred threshold values are then also displayed as a yellow and red line in the graph.

[TIP]
====
This dynamic calculation does _not_ mean that any threshold values can be modified via the monitoring rules defined in {CMK}.
The threshold values supplied in the local check are always used for the actual calculation.
====

The output would then look like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My 1st dynamic service" count=40;30;50 Result is computed from two threshold values
P "My 2nd dynamic service" - Result is computed with no values
----

&#8230; and the display in a service view like this:

image::localchecks_dynsrv.png[alt=“The service list with two dynamically calculated services.”]

This display differs from the previous one in two respects:

* For services in the {WARN} or {CRIT} state, the [.guihint]#Summary# of the service shows all of the important information of the metrics (name, value, thresholds).
This means you can always see how this state was calculated from a value.
For all other states, the metrics information is only displayed in the [.guihint]#Details# field.

* If no metrics are transferred, the service state will always be {OK}.


[#flexible_evaluation]
==== Alternating between dynamic and static state evaluation

It can be useful to switch between dynamic and static state evaluation in the script that provides the local check.
As an example, let's take a backup script that writes a xref:spool_directory#[spool file] in the format of a local check.
The state evaluation according to backup duration should be dynamic, and the script should therefore write a `P`:

[{shell}]
----
P "Backup stuff" duration=2342;1800;3600 Successfully created the backup. Good luck restoring.
----

However, if the backup fails after a short time, the state is determined by the backup script's return value and not by threshold values.
In this case, the script must set the state statically with a number:

[{shell}]
----
2 "Backup stuff" duration=123;1800;3600 Backup failed. Nuff said.
----

In this case, it simply makes sense that no threshold values are displayed in the graph,
since it is not a question of the _required duration_ up to the (failed) backup, but the fact that the backup was _not_ successful.


[#upper_lower_thresholds]
=== Upper and lower threshold values

Some parameters not only have upper thresholds, but also lower thresholds.
One example of this is humidity recording.
For such cases, the local check provides the option of passing two threshold values each for the {WARN} and {CRIT} states.
These are separated by a colon and represent the lower and upper threshold values respectively.

In the general syntax it looks like this:

[{shell}]
----
metricname=value;warn_lower:warn_upper;crit_lower:crit_upper
----

&#8230; in the example like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My 3rd service" humidity=37;40:60;30:70 A service with lower and upper thresholds
----

&#8230; and in the display of a service view like this:

image::localchecks_lower.png[alt="A service with state evaluation from lower and upper threshold values."]

If you are only interested in lower threshold values, omit the fields for the upper threshold values:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My 4th dynamic service" count_lower=37;40:;30: A service with lower thresholds only
----

With this output, you specify that the service should become {WARN} if the value is less than 40 and {CRIT} if it is less than 30:
the service will therefore receive the {WARN} state if the specified value is 37.

[TIP]
====
The metrics and graphing system in {CMK} is restricted to upper thresholds due to considerations in favor of simplicity. 
This means that while determining the state of a service works as expected, the information displayed in the metrics and graphing component ignores lower thresholds.
For this reason elements such as yellow and red lines in graphs, Perf-O-Meters and [guihint]#Service performance data# are completely missing in the {CMK} GUI when only lower thresholds are used.
====


[#multi-line]
=== Multi-line outputs

The option to spread an output over multiple lines is also available.
Because {CMK} runs under Linux you can work with the Escape sequence `'\n'` in order to force a line-break.
Even if due to the scripting language the backslash itself needs to be escaped, it will be correctly interpreted by {CMK}:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My service" humidity=37;40:60;30:70 My service output\nA line with details\nAnother line with details
----

In the service's details these additional lines will be visible under the [.guihint]#Summary#:

image::localchecks_srv_details.png[alt=“The service details with a multi-line output.”]


[#cache]
== Executing asynchronously

The output of local checks, like that of agent plug-ins, can be _cached_.
This can be necessary if a script has a longer processing time.
Such a script is then executed asynchronously and only in a defined time interval and the last output is cached.
If the agent is queried again before the time expires, it uses this cache for the local check and returns it in the agent output.

[TIP]
====
Caching is only available for AIX, FreeBSD, Linux, OpenWrt and Windows.
On other platforms, use cronjobs in combination with the xref:spool_directory#[spool directory].
====


[#cache_linux]
=== Configuring Linux

Under Linux or another Unix-like operating system, any plug-in can be executed asynchronously.
For a local check, the necessary configuration is very similar to that of a xref:agent_linux#async_plugins[plug-in].
To do this, create a subdirectory called the number of seconds you want the output to be cached and put your script in that subdirectory.

In the following example, the local check will be executed only every 10 minutes (600 seconds):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/600/mylocalcheck
2 "My cached service" count=4 Some output of a long running script
----

The cached data is written to a xref:folders_cache[cache directory].

For a service that provides cached data, the cache-specific information is added to the service view:

image::localchecks_srv_cached.png[alt=“A service that outputs cached data.”]


[#cache_windows]
=== Configuring Windows

Under Windows, the configuration is also analogous to that of a xref:agent_windows#customizeexecution[agent plug-in].
Instead of using a special subdirectory as with Linux & Co, the options are set in a configuration file:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{yaml}]
----
local:
    enabled: yes
    execution:
        - pattern     : $CUSTOM_LOCAL_PATH$\mylocalcheck.bat
          async       : yes
          run         : yes
          cache_age   : 600
----

As you can see above, under Windows you can configure the asynchronous execution (with `async`) and the time interval (with `cache_age`) separately.

ifdef::onprem[]
Alternatively, on Windows you can also do the configuration in the xref:bakery[Agent Bakery].
endif::[]


ifdef::onprem[]
[#bakery]
== Distribution via the Agent Bakery

{cee-only}
If you are already using the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery] in the commercial editions, you can also distribute the scripts with local checks to several hosts this way.

To do this, first create the directory `custom` on the {CMK} server as site user below `~/local/share/check_mk/agents/` and in it a subdirectory tree for each package of local checks:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cd ~/local/share/check_mk/agents
OMD[mysite]:~/local/share/check_mk/agents$ mkdir -p custom/mycustompackage/lib/local/
----

The package directory in the above example is `mycustompackage`.
Below that, the `lib` directory flags the script as a plug-in or as a local check.
The subsequent `local` directory then allocates the file explicitly.
Place the script with the local check in this directory.

[TIP]
====
On Linux, you can configure asynchronous execution analogously as described in the xref:cache[previous chapter] by now creating a directory under `custom/mycustompackage/lib/local/` with the number of seconds of the execution interval and placing the script there.
Under Windows, you can use the rule sets [.guihint]#Set execution mode for plug-ins and local checks# and [.guihint]#Set cache age for plug-ins and local checks#.
These and other rule sets for local checks under Windows can be found in the Agent Bakery under [.guihint]#Agent rules > Windows agent options#.
====

In the configuration environment of {CMK}, the package directory `mycustompackage` will be shown as a new option:
Open [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX#, create a new rule with [.guihint]#Agents > Agent rules > Generic agent options > Deploy custom files with agent# and select the newly-created package:

image::localchecks_custom.png[alt=“Rule for storing the script files in a package directory.”]

{CMK} will then autonomously integrate the local check correctly into the
installation packet for the appropriate operating system.
After the changes have been activated and the agent baked, the configuration will be complete.
Now the agents only need to be distributed.
endif::[]


[#diagnose]
== Error analysis

=== Testing the script

If you run into problems with a self-written script, you should check the following potential error sources:

* Is the script in its correct xref:folders_script[directory]?

* Is the script executable, and are the access permissions correct?
This is especially relevant if you are not running the agent or script under root or the LocalSystem account.

* Is the output compliant with the given syntax?
The output of the local check must conform to the syntax as described in the chapters xref:syntax[Creating the script] and xref:metrics[Metrics].
Otherwise, error-free execution cannot be guaranteed.
+
Problems and errors can arise in particular when a local check is intended to perform a task that requires a xref:devel_intro#[full-fledged check plug-in], for example when the output of the local check itself contains a _section header_ or the definition of a host name as used when transporting xref:glossar#piggyback[piggyback] data.

[TIP]
====
Under Linux, when the agent script or the plug-in is called directly in a shell, different link:https://wiki.debian.org/EnvironmentVariables[environment variables^] may be available than when called by the Agent Controller of the xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agent].
Under Windows, the Agent Controller also runs under the LocalSystem account, but the call in the terminal is made under a normal user or administrator.
In addition to the different environment, this can mean that permissions are missing.
In order to be able to analyze the output from the agent script as closely as possible to the conditions under which the {CMK} agent is called, you should use the xref:agent_linux#agent_ctl_dump[Agent Controller in dump mode] if possible.
====


=== Testing agent output on the target host

If the script itself is correct, the agent can be run on the host.
With Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, BSD, etc., the command below is available.
With the `-A` option the number of additional lines to be displayed following a hit can be specified.
This number can be customized to suit the number of expected output lines:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} cmk-agent-ctl dump | grep -v grep | grep -A2 "<<<local"
<<<local:sep(0)>>>
P "My service" humidity=37;40:60;30:70 My service output\nA line with details\nAnother line with details
cached(1618580356,600) 2 "My cached service" count=4 Some output of a long running script
----

In the last line, you can recognize a cached service by the preceding `cached` information with the current Unix time and the execution interval in seconds.

Under Windows, you can achieve a very similar result with PowerShell and the `Select-String` 'cmdlet' as with the `grep` command under Linux. In the following command, the two digits behind the `Context` parameter determine how many lines are to be output before and after the hit:

++++
<div class="listingblock copybutton">
    <div class="content">
        <pre
            class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="doscon"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">PS C:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service&gt;</span> ./cmk-agent-ctl.exe dump | Select-String -Pattern "&lt;&lt;&lt;local" -Context 0,3
<span class="tok-go">&lt;&lt;&lt;local:sep(0)&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="tok-go">0 "My 1st service" - This static service is always OK</span>

<span class="tok-go">cached(1618580520,600) 1 "My cached service on Windows" count=4 Some output of a long running script</span></code></pre>
    </div>
</div>
++++

[TIP]
====
Depending on the environment, programming language used, Windows version and some other conditions, you are often confronted with the _UTF-16_ character set under Windows.
In addition, the combination of _Carriage Return_ and _Line Feed_ for line breaks is frequently encountered there.
However, {CMK} as a Linux application expects _UTF-8_ and simple _Line Feeds_ without any ifs and buts.
Our article on the spool directory includes xref:spool_directory#charset[a chapter] explaining the troubleshooting of character set-related problems.

=== Testing agent output on the {CMK} server

ifdef::onprem[]
As a last step the processing of the script output can also be tested on the {CMK} server with the `cmk` command -- once for the service discovery:

[{shell}]

{c-omd} cmk -nv --detect-plugins=local mycmkserver
+ FETCHING DATA
Get piggybacked data
My cached service    [red]#Some output of a long running script(!!), Cache generated 6 minutes 30 seconds ago, cache interval: 10 minutes 0 seconds, elapsed cache lifespan: 68.71%#
My service           [yellow]#My service output, Humidity: 37.00 (warn/crit below 40.00/30.00)(!)#
[agent] Success, [piggyback] Success (but no data found for this host), execution time 3.3 sec ...

For both commands we have shortened the output by lines not relevant for this topic.
endif::[]

ifdef::saas[]
To identify whether and how the output of the local check is contained in the agent output,
endif::[]
ifdef::onprem[]
Alternatively,
endif::[]
you can open the service list of the host in the monitoring, navigate to the service [guihint]#Check_MK# and its column [guihint]#Icons#.
There you can choose the menu entry [guihint]#Download agent output# to retrieve a text file containing the complete agent output.

If there are errors in a local check, {CMK} will identify them in the service output.
This applies as well for erroneous metrics, for false or incomplete information in the script output, or an invalid state.
These error messages should aid in quickly identifying errors in a script.


[#folders]
== Files and directories

All specified paths refer to installation packages that have been packaged with standard configurations.
If you have installed a non-packed agent script or have adapted the installation directories using a Bakery rule, look up the paths in the script itself or adapt the paths to your own configuration.

[#folders_script]
=== Script directory on the target host

You store local checks in these directories.
Local checks can be any executable files.

[cols="50,~",options="header"]
|===
|Path |Operating system
|`/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/` | AIX, Linux and Solaris
|`%ProgramData%\checkmk\agent\local` |Windows
|===


[#folders_cache]
=== Cache directory on the target host

Cached data of individual sections, including the `local` section, are stored here and reattached to the agent with each execution as long as the data is valid.
