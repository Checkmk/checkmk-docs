== Why own checks?

{CMK} already monitors many types of relevant data using a large number of
its own standard check plug-ins.
Nevertheless, every IT environment is unique, so that often very specialized requirements can arise.
With *local checks* you have a facility to extend the agent on the target host for quickly and easily creating your own services.

These local plug-ins differ in one significant aspect from other checks:
the calculation of a status occurs directly in the host on which the data is
also retrieved.
In this way the complex creation of checks in Python is not needed and there is thus a completely free choice of coding language for scripts.

ifdef::saas[]
A big advantage of local checks is that no plug-in installation is needed within the {CMK} site.
Only a service scan is necessary.
Local checks thus are well suited for restrictively managed {CMK} installations and {CE} (SaaS).
endif::[]

[#simple_check]
== Writing a simple local check


[#syntax]
=== Creating the script

A local check can be written in any programming language supported by the target host.
The script must be constructed so that each check produces a status line
consisting of four parts.
Here is an example:

[{shell}]
----
0 "My service" myvalue=73 My output text which may contain spaces
----

The four parts are separated by blanks and have the following meanings:

[cols="25,20,~"]
|===
|Example value |Meaning |Description

|`0` |Status |The status of the service is given as a number: `0` for {OK}, `1` for {WARN}, `2` for {CRIT} and `3` for {UNKNOWN}. Alternatively, the status can also be xref:dynamic_state[calculated dynamically]: then the number is replaced by a `P`.
|`"My service"` |Service name |The service name as shown in {CMK}, in the output of the check in double quotes.
|`myvalue=73;65;75` |Value and metrics |Metric values for the data. More information about the construction can be found in the chapter on xref:metrics[metrics]. Alternatively a minus sign can be coded if the check produces no metrics.
|`My output text which may contain spaces` |Status detail |Details for the status as they will be shown in {CMK}. This part can also contain blanks.
|===

There must always be *exactly one space* (ASCII `0x20`) between the four parts of this output.
Within the status details, any spaces can be used in any order.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deviations from the specification just described _may_ work, but _must_ not.
Future versions of {CMK} may enforce this output format and ignore deviating local checks.
====

If you are unsure about a possible output, you can simply test it by writing a small script with the `echo` command.
Insert the output you want to test into the `echo` command.
Our example uses double quotation marks on the outside, as variables inside (environment variables and those set in the script) are evaluated.
As a result, you must enclose the quotation marks for the service name with `\` so that these characters are not interpreted by the shell as the end and beginning of a string (and thus removed from the output):

.mylocalcheck
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "0 \"My 1st service\" - This static service is always OK"
----

For Windows hosts, such a script will look very similar to this:

.mylocalcheck.bat
[{file}]
----
@echo off
echo 0 "My 1st service" - This static service is always OK
----

Both scripts produce the same result in the output:

[{shell}]
----
0 "My 1st service" - This static service is always OK
----

For {CMK} only this output is relevant, not how you created this output.

By the way -- you can write any number of outputs in a script.
Each output line will have its own service created in {CMK}.
Therefore, no newline characters are allowed in the output -- unless they are masked, for example for a xref:multi-line[multi-line output] in {CMK}.

How it can be checked whether the local script will be correctly invoked by the agent can be seen in the xref:diagnose[Error analysis].

include::include_special_chars.asciidoc[]

[#distribute]
=== Distributing the script

Once the script has been written it can be distributed to the appropriate hosts.
The path used will depend on the operating system.
A list of path names can be found in xref:folders_script[Files and directories] below.

Don't forget to make the script executable on Unix-like systems.
The path shown in this example is for Linux:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod +x /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
----

ifdef::onprem[]
If you use the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery], the script can be distributed with a rule-based procedure.
More on rule-creation can be found in the chapter xref:bakery[Distribution via the Agent Bakery].
endif::[]


[#add_service]
=== Adding the service to the monitoring

At every invocation of the {CMK} agent the local check contained in the script will also be executed and appended to the agent's output.
The xref:wato_services#discovery[service discovery] also functions automatically like with other services:

image::localchecks_services.png[]

Once the service has been added to the monitoring and the changes have been activated, the implementation of the self-created service with the aid of a local check will be complete.
Should a problem arise during the service discovery, the xref:diagnose[Error analysis] can be of help.


[#extended_functions]
== Extended functions


[#metrics]
=== Metrics

With a local script metrics can also be set.
To enable them the value of the check must always return `P`.
Then the state will be calculated by {CMK}.

The general syntax for this data is as follows:

[{shell}]
----
metricname=value;warn;crit;min;max
----

where `value` is the current value, `warn` and `crit` set the (upper) thresholds, and `min` and `max` fix the range of values -- for example like this:

[{shell}]
----
count=73;80;90;0;100
----

The values are separated with a semicolon.
All values except `value` are optional.
If a value is not required, the field remains empty or is omitted at the end, as in the following for `warn`, `crit` and `max`:

[{shell}]
----
count=42;;;0
----

*Note:* In the commercial editions the values for `min` and `max` can indeed be set -- but only for compatibility reasons.
Limiting the associated graph to a certain range of values has no effect in the commercial editions.


[#metricname]
=== Metric name

You should take special care when choosing the identifier of this metric - called `metricname` in the example here.
We recommend prefixing the identifiers to prevent overlap with metrics already present in {CMK}.

So, for example, instead of simply calling a metric that represents the number of
currently waiting requests in a queue you are monitoring, 'current',
we recommend a clearer identifier with a prefix - such as: `mycompany_current_requests`.

If you were to choose an identifier here that already exists in {CMK}, the
representation of your metrics in graphs would be overwritten with the
definitions that already exist.

Of course, you can also reuse an existing metric from {CMK} intentionally. So,
for a metric for an electrical current you could simply use the identifier
`current` in your local check. In case of doubt, however, you have to look up
the definition of this metric in `~/lib/python3/cmk/gui/plugins/metric` by
yourself.

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} grep -r -A 4 'metric_info\["current"\]' ./lib/python3/cmk/gui/plugins/metrics/
----


[#multiple_metrics]
=== Multiple metrics

You can also have several metrics output.
These are then separated by the 'pipe' character `|`, for example like this:

[{shell}]
----
count1=42|count2=23
----

*Attention:* On Windows hosts you have to prefix a caret (`^`) to the pipe in the script, so that it does not get interpreted.

.mylocalcheck.bat
[{file}]
----
@echo off
echo 0 "My 2nd service" count1=42^|count2=23 A service with 2 graphs
----

A complete *output* with two metrics will look like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
0 "My 2nd service" count1=42|count2=23 A service with 2 graphs
----

After you have also included the new service in the monitoring, you will see the text for the status detail in the [.guihint]#Summary# field in the service list.
After clicking on the service, the page with the service details is displayed.
The metrics are shown in the [.guihint]#Details# field and below this you will see the service graphs automatically generated by {CMK}:

image::localchecks_graphs2.png[]


[#dynamic_state]
=== Calculating status dynamically

In the previous chapters, you learned how to set threshold values for metrics and how to display them in the graphs.
The next obvious step is to use these thresholds for a dynamic calculation of the service state.
 {CMK} provides exactly these options for extending a local check.

If you pass the letter `P` instead of a number in the first field of the output that determines the state, the service's status will be calculated on the basis of the threshold as provided.

An output will then look like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My 1st dynamic service" count=40;30;50 Result is computed from two threshold values
P "My 2nd dynamic service" - Result is computed with no values
----

&#8230; and the display in a service view like this:

image::localchecks_dynsrv.png[]

The display differs in two points from the one that we saw earlier:

* For services in the {WARN} or {CRIT} state, the [.guihint]#Summary# of the service shows all important information about the metrics (name, value, thresholds).
This means you can always see how this status was calculated from a value.
For all other states, the metric information is only displayed in the [.guihint]#Details# field.

* If no metrics have been passed the service's status will always be {OK}.


[#upper_lower_thresholds]
=== Upper and lower thresholds

Some parameters have not only an upper threshold but also a lower threshold.
An example is humidity.
For such cases the local check has the option of passing two threshold values each for the states {WARN} and {CRIT}.
They are separated by a colon and represent the lower and the upper threshold value respectively.

In the general syntax, it looks like this:

[{shell}]
----
metricname=value;warn_lower:warn_upper;crit_lower:crit_upper
----

&#8230; and in the example like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My 3rd service" humidity=37;40:60;30:70 A service with lower and upper thresholds
----

&#8230; and in the display of a service view like this:

image::localchecks_lower.png[]

If you are only concerned with lower thresholds, leave out the upper threshold fields:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My 4th dynamic service" count_lower=37;40:;30: A service with lower thresholds only
----

With this output, you specify that the service should become {WARN} if the value is less than 40 and {CRIT} if it is less than 30: thus, at the specified value of 37, the service will get the {WARN} state.


[#multi-line]
=== Multi-line outputs

The option to spread an output over multiple lines is also available.
Because {CMK} runs under Linux you can work with the Escape sequence `'\n'` in order to force a line-break.
Even if due to the scripting language the backslash itself needs to be escaped, it will be correctly interpreted by {CMK}:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mylocalcheck
P "My service" humidity=37;40:60;30:70 My service output\nA line with details\nAnother line with details
----

In the service's details these additional lines will be visible under the [.guihint]#Summary#:

image::localchecks_srv_details.png[]


[#cache]
=== Executing asynchronously and caching output

The output of local checks, like that of agent plug-ins, can be _cached_.
This can be necessary if a script has a longer processing time.
Such a script is then executed asynchronously and only in a defined time interval and the last output is cached.
If the agent is queried again before the time expires, it uses this cache for the local check and returns it in the agent output.

*Note*: Caching is only available for AIX, FreeBSD, Linux, OpenWrt and Windows.


==== Configuring Linux

Under Linux or another Unix-like operating system, any plug-in can be executed asynchronously.
For a local check, the necessary configuration is very similar to that of a xref:agent_linux#async_plugins[plug-in].
To do this, create a subdirectory called the number of seconds you want the output to be cached and put your script in that subdirectory.

In the following example, the local check will be executed only every 10 minutes (600 seconds):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/600/mylocalcheck
2 "My cached service" count=4 Some output of a long running script
----

The cached data is written to a xref:folders_cache[cache directory].

For a service that provides cached data, the cache-specific information is added to the service view:

image::localchecks_srv_cached.png[]


==== Configuring Windows

Under Windows, the configuration is also analogous to that of a xref:agent_windows#customizeexecution[plug-in].
Instead of using a special subdirectory as with Linux & Co, the options are set in a configuration file:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
local:
    enabled: yes
    execution:
        - pattern     : $CUSTOM_LOCAL_PATH$\mylocalcheck.bat
          async       : yes
          run         : yes
          cache_age   : 600
----

As you can see above, under Windows you can configure the asynchronous execution (with `async`) and the time interval (with `cache_age`) separately.

ifdef::onprem[]
Alternatively, on Windows you can also do the configuration in the xref:bakery[Agent Bakery].
endif::[]


ifdef::onprem[]
[#bakery]
== Distribution via the Agent Bakery

{cee-only}
If you are already using the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery], you can also distribute the scripts with local checks to several hosts this way.

To do this, first create the directory `custom` on the {CMK} server as site user below `~/local/share/check_mk/agents/` and in it a subdirectory tree for each package of local checks:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cd ~/local/share/check_mk/agents
{c-omd} ~/local/share/check_mk/agents$ mkdir -p custom/mycustompackage/lib/local/
----

The package directory in the above example is `mycustompackage`.
Below that, the `lib` directory flags the script as a plug-in or as a local check.
The subsequent `local` directory then allocates the file explicitly.
Place the script with the local check in this directory.

*Important:* On Linux, you can configure asynchronous execution analogously as described in the xref:cache[previous chapter] by now creating a directory under `custom/mycustompackage/lib/local/` with the number of seconds of the execution interval and placing the script there.
Under Windows, you can use the rule sets [.guihint]#Set execution mode for plugins and local checks# and [.guihint]#Set cache age for plugins and local checks#. These and other rule sets for local checks under Windows can be found in the Agent Bakery under [.guihint]#Agent rules > Windows Agent#.

In the configuration environment of {CMK}, the package directory `mycustompackage` will be shown as a new option:
Open [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX#, create a new rule with [.guihint]#Agents > Agent rules > Generic options > Deploy custom files with agent# and select the newly-created package:

image::localchecks_custom.png[]

{CMK} will then autonomously integrate the local check correctly into the
installation packet for the appropriate operating system.
After the changes have been activated and the agent baked, the configuration will be complete.
Now the agents only need to be distributed.
endif::[]

[#diagnose]
== Error analysis


=== Testing the script

If you run into problems with a self-written script, you should check the following potential error sources:

* Is the script in its correct xref:folders_script[directory]?

* Is the script executable, and are the access permissions correct?
This is especially relevant if you are not running the agent or script under root or the LocalSystem account.

* Is the output compliant with the given syntax?
The output of the local check must conform to the syntax as described in the chapters xref:syntax[Creating the script] and xref:extended_functions[Extended functions].
Otherwise, error-free execution cannot be guaranteed.
+
Problems and errors can arise in particular when a local check is intended to perform a task that requires a xref:devel_intro#[full-fledged check plug-in], for example when the output of the local check itself contains a _section header_ or the definition of a host name as used when transporting xref:piggyback#[piggyback data].

[TIP]
====
Under Linux, when the agent script or the plug-in is called directly in a shell, different link:https://wiki.debian.org/EnvironmentVariables[environment variables^] may be available than when called by the Agent Controller of the xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agent].
Under Windows, the Agent Controller also runs under the LocalSystem account, but the call in the terminal is made under a normal user or administrator.
In addition to the different environment, this can mean that permissions are missing.
In order to be able to analyze the output from the agent script as closely as possible to the conditions under which the {CMK} agent is called, you should use the xref:agent_linux#agent_ctl_dump[Agent Controller in dump mode] if possible.
====


=== Testing agent output on the target host

If the script itself is correct, the agent can be run on the host.
With Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, BSD, etc., the command below is available.
With the `-A` option the number of additional lines to be displayed following a hit can be specified.
This number can be customized to suit the number of expected output lines:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} cmk-agent-ctl dump | grep -v grep | grep -A2 "<<<local"
<<<local:sep(0)>>>
P "My service" humidity=37;40:60;30:70 My service output\nA line with details\nAnother line with details
cached(1618580356,600) 2 "My cached service" count=4 Some output of a long running script
----

In the last line, you can recognize a cached service by the preceding `cache` information with the current Unix time and the execution interval in seconds.

Under Windows, you can achieve a very similar result with PowerShell and the `Select-String` 'cmdlet' as with the `grep` command under Linux. In the following command, the two digits behind the `Context` parameter determine how many lines are to be output before and after the hit:

[{shell-raw}]
----
PS C:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service> ./cmk-agent-ctl.exe dump | Select-String -Pattern "<<<local" -Context 0,3
> <<<local:sep(0)>>>
  0 "My 1st service" - This static service is always OK

  cached(1618580520,600) 1 "My cached service on Windows" count=4 Some output of a long running script
----

[TIP]
====
Depending on the environment, programming language used, Windows version and some other conditions, you are often confronted with the _UTF-16_ character set under Windows.
In addition, the combination of _Carriage Return_ and _Line Feed_ for line breaks is frequently encountered there.
However, {CMK} as a Linux application expects _UTF-8_ and simple _Line Feeds_ without any ifs and buts.
Our article on the spool directory includes xref:spool_directory#charset[a chapter] explaining the troubleshooting of character set-related problems.
====


=== Testing agent output on the {CMK} server

ifdef::onprem[]
As a last step the processing of the script output can also be tested on the {CMK} server with the `cmk` command -- once for the service discovery:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -IIv --detect-plugins=local mycmkserver
Discovering services and host labels on: mycmkserver
mycmkserver:
...
+ EXECUTING DISCOVERY PLUGINS (1)
  [green]#2# local
[green]#SUCCESS# - Found 2 services, no host labels
----

&#8230; and also the processing of the service output with a similar command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -nv --detect-plugins=local mycmkserver
Checkmk version 2.0.0p2
+ FETCHING DATA
...
+ PARSE FETCHER RESULTS
Received no piggyback data
My cached service    [red]#Some output of a long running script(!!), Cache generated 6 minutes 52 seconds ago, Cache interval: 10 minutes 0 seconds, Elapsed cache lifespan: 68.71%#
My service           [yellow]#My service output\, humidity: 37.00 (warn/crit below 40.00/30.00)(!)#
----

For both commands we have shortened the output by lines not relevant for this topic.
endif::[]

ifdef::saas[]
To identify whether and how the output of the local check is contained in the agent output,
endif::[]
ifdef::onprem[]
Alternatively,
endif::[]
you can open the service list of the host in the monitoring, navigate to the service [guihint]#Check_MK# and its column [guihint]#Icons#.
There you can choose the menu entry [guihint]#Download agent output# to retrieve a text file containing the complete agent output.

If there are errors in a local check, {CMK} will identify them in the service output.
This applies as well for erroneous metrics, for false or incomplete information in the script output, or an invalid status.
These error messages should aid in quickly identifying errors in a script.
