[#intro]
== Introduction

In this article you will learn how to set up a login via _Secure Assertion Markup Language_ (SAML).

SAML is a standardized method for informing external applications and services that a user is actually who they claim to be.
SAML makes single sign-on (SSO) possible because it can be used to authenticate a user once and then communicate that authentication to multiple applications.
With the help of the connection and communication between the so-called 'Service Provider' (SP) and the so-called 'Identity Provider' (IdP), it is thus possible for employees to access various web applications with just a single login.

{CMK} takes the role of the Service Provider (SP) in the SAML design.

In the commercial editions, you can make the SAML settings directly in {CMK}.
For example, as xref:saml_cee[described in the next section], Azure Active Directory (AD) acts as the Identity Provider (IdP).

Since SAML settings in {CMK} are not supported in the {CRE}, a different approach must be taken in this situation.
Thus, in the section xref:saml_re[Setting up SAML in the {RE}] we describe the configuration with mod_auth_mellon and Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) as an example.

*Caution:* The whole topic of transport encryption (TLS/SSL) is only included in the examples in a simple, demonstration implementation.
In production environments link:https://checkmk.com/blog/how-become-your-own-certificate-authority[with your own Certificate Authority (CA)^] and proper certificate handling, there will be some differences which will depend on your own infrastructure.


[#use_saml]
== Using SAML in {CMK}

Once you have gone through all of the points of the process of setup, the SAML login can be used by the user in {CMK}. The button text can be customized, as xref:configure_saml[described below.]

image::saml_login.png[alt="{CMK} login with SAML button.", width=55%]

Any user authorized by SAML will be automatically created in {CMK} the first time they log in there -- provided that there is not already a user with the same ID.
If a user with the same ID already exists, the current user creation will be rejected.

The user data will be synchronized every time the user logs in to {CMK}.

Several prerequisites must be met for SAML to function:

* The xref:omd_https#[web interface must be secured with HTTPS]. For security reasons HTTP addresses are not accepted.

* {CMK}'s SAML endpoints for ID/metadata and responses (Assertion Consumer Service) must have been registered with the IdP. Below we will show how this can be done.

* Messages directed by the IdP to {CMK} -- responses to authentication requests (only mandatory for the assertion) and attribute statements -- must be signed with one of the xref:supported_algorithms[supported algorithms].


[#supported_algorithms]
=== Supported algorithms

{CMK} accepts the following algorithms for communication with the IdP:

* RSA-SHA256
* RSA-SHA384
* RSA-SHA512
* ECDSA-SHA256
* ECDSA-SHA384
* ECDSA-SHA512

{CMK} itself uses RSA-SHA256 for signing its requests.

If the IdP does not use any of the above algorithms for its response, the response will be rejected by {CMK}.


[#saml_cee]
== Setting up SAML in the commercial editions

To be able to use SAML in the commercial editions, the IdP must first be set up -- in our example this is Azure AD.
Once this has been done, the SP, i.e. {CMK}, will be provided with the required information.


[#access_azure]
=== Logging into Azure Active Directory (AD)

==== Registering the {CMK}-SAML-Service in Azure AD

Next, register the {CMK} SAML service with Azure AD. To do this, call [.guihint]#Enterprise applications > New applications > Create your own application#.

image::saml_azure_own_application.png[alt="Creating your own application in Azure AD."]

Assign an arbitrary name, e.g. 'checkmk-saml'.
_Note:_ We recommend NOT naming the application simply 'checkmk' to avoid confusion with the {CMK} agent.

Select the [.guihint]#Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)# option and then click the [.guihint]#Create# button.

On the Azure AD overview page you will have created the following function: [.guihint]#Single sign-on > SAML > Basic SAML Configuration:#

image::saml_azure_sign_on.png[alt="Overview of application data in Azure AD."]

At this point, Azure will require two more pieces of information:

* the [.guihint]#Identifier (Entity ID)# in the `\https://myserver.com/mysite/check_mk/saml_metadata.py` format, and

* the [.guihint]#Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)# in the `\https://myserver.com/mysite/check_mk/saml_acs.py?acs` format.

Leave all other options unchanged at their default value or empty. In particular, the [.guihint]#Relay State# in the [.guihint]#Basic SAML Configuration# must remain unchanged, otherwise SAML will not work.

Now call [.guihint]#Edit > Signing Option > Sign SAML assertion# to configure Azure AD for responses and verifications:

image::saml_signing_certificate.png[alt="SAML access data in Azure AD."]


[#url_from_azure]
==== Retrieving SAML information from Azure AD

Next, go to Azure AD to find the SAML information you need for {CMK}.

This is available in the [.guihint]#Enterprise applications | All applications > Browse Azure AD Gallery > checkmk-saml | SAML-based Sign-On# view (see above):

* In the [.guihint]#SAML Certificates# box, find the [.guihint]#App Federation Metadata Url.# You will need this in the next section for setting up SAML in {CMK} [.guihint]#(Identity provider metadata)#.

* The [.guihint]#Attributes & Claims# box takes you to a view of the user attributes for {CMK}, e.g. email address, first and last name of the user:

image::saml_attributes_claims.png[alt="View of user attributes in Azure AD."]


[#configure_saml]
=== Activating SAML in the {CMK} web interface

With the information obtained earlier, set up the SAML connection on the {CMK} side. 

If necessary, add the TLS certificate issued by your IdP to the trusted certificates in {CMK} by entering it in [.guihint]#Setup > Global settings > Trusted certificate authorities for SSL#.

Now open the settings under [.guihint]#Setup > Users > SAML Authentication.# Use [.guihint]#Add connection,# there to start configuring a new connection:

image::saml_saml_authentication.png[alt="The SAML Authentication rule in {CMK}."]

Assign a [.guihint]#Connection ID# and a [.guihint]#Name# for the new connection.
The [.guihint]#Name# will be used afterwards for xref:use_saml[naming the {CMK} login button].

Next, in the [.guihint]#Security# box, you specify whether you want to secure the access connections with {CMK} or with your own certificates:

image::saml_security.png[alt="Selecting the security certificate for SAML."]

If you use your own certificates, you must specify the [.guihint]#Private key# and the [.guihint]#Certificate#.
Custom certificates are stored in the site directory under `~/etc/ssl/saml2/custom/`.

Next, in the [.guihint]#Connection# box, as the [.guihint]#Identity provider metadata# enter the URL (e.g. App Federation Metadata URL) you selected as described in the xref:url_from_azure[previous section]:

image::saml_connection.png[alt="Enter connection data."]

Alternatively, you can download the metadata XML file directly from Azure AD and upload it in the dialog above with the option [.guihint]#Upload XML file# in the [.guihint]#Identity provider metadata.#
This is convenient, for example, if your {CMK} server has no access to the Internet.

For the mandatory [.guihint]#{CMK} server URL#, enter the address you -- not Azure -- normally use to access {CMK}, e.g. `\https://myserver.com`.

You will now need to enter the user details into the [.guihint]#Users# box:

image::saml_users.png[alt="Entering user information."]

You also need to obtain this information as described in the xref:url_from_azure[previous section].
It is important to note that the [.guihint]#User ID attribute# must be unique, for instance the user ID.
{CMK} here requires the complete [.guihint]#claim name# from Azure AD, i.e. the URL address starting with _http_, for each entry.
For instance, in the above example, the user ID is `\http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/userID`.

In order to define the responsibilities for all users who authenticate themselves with SAML in {CMK}, each xref:wato_user#contact_groups[user can be assigned to one or more contact groups].
You have various options for defining the mapping in the [.guihint]#contact groups#.

You can use the [.guihint]#Roles# to assign users to different roles in order to define normal users, administrators, etc.


[#saml_re]
== Setting up SAML in the {RE}

If you do not configure the SAML connection via the {CMK} interface, use the link:https://github.com/Uninett/mod_auth_mellon[mod_auth_mellon^] Apache module instead.
This handles the authentication as a service provider via SAML.

The following sections only describe the configuration of Mellon/Apache for any IdPs that may already be running, using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) as an example.
The connection in {CMK} itself is limited to the last step from the ADFS instructions.


=== Logging in with Active Directory Federation Services

*Note:* This feature is not supported by SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) versions 12 SP3, 12 SP4 and 15 due to missing dependencies (SLES 15 SP1 and later do allow connectivity).


==== Prerequisites

Logging on to {CMK} using Active Directory is basically relatively simple:
Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) serves as _Identity Provider_ (IdP), {CMK} provides the authentication via _Security Assertion Markup Language_ (SAML).

Prerequisites for this tutorial are accordingly:

* Functioning LDAP-AD integration
* Working ADFS as IdP
* {CMK} server with SSL
* A supported operating system. Currently, SLES 15 SP4 is _not_ supported!

The setup is accomplished in three steps:

. Configuration of Apache (one result: XML file with metadata).
. Configuring ADFS: setting up Relying Party Trust with Mellon metadata.
. Enabling the login to {CMK} itself.


==== Configuration of Apache

Additional dependencies may still need to be installed, under Debian/Ubuntu for example:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt-get update
{c-root} apt-get install wget libxmlsec1-openssl
----

*Note:* In the {CMK} appliance, `libxmlsec1-openssl` is already installed.

This is, of course, about configuring the site's own Apache server, so log in there first:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd su mysite
----

Now create a directory for mod_auth_mellon and switch to it:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkdir etc/apache/mellon
{c-omd} cd etc/apache/mellon
----

Now run `mellon_create_metadata` specifying your server as well as your site with the `mellon` suffix:

[{shell-raw}]
----
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ mellon_create_metadata https://myserver "https://myserver/mysite/mellon"
----

This module generates three files: Certificate (`.cert`), key (`.key`) and static metadata (`.xml`).
The `.xml` file is not required and can be deleted:

[{shell}]
----
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ rm *.xml
----

Rename the key and certificate files for simplicity:

[{shell}]
----
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ mv *.key mellon.key
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ mv *.cert mellon.cert
----

Now get the required metadata directly from your ADFS server (here `myadfs`) and save it as `idp-metadata.xml`:

[{shell-raw}]
----
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ wget --no-check-certificate -O ./idp-metadata.xml https://myadfs/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml 
----

Now you need the public certificate for the ADFS server, which is stored in the `idp-public-key.pem` file:

[{shell}]
----
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ echo -n | openssl s_client -connect myadfs:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout > idp-public-key.pem
----

Just in case you are wondering about the `echo -n`: This is used to terminate the following SSL session.

*Note:* The certificate should, or even _must_ be uploaded to the trust store in case, for example, the IdP service checks the certificate chain.
For more information on this topic, see the xref:omd_https#[HTTPS article].

As a last step, replace the authentication configuration file `~/etc/apache/conf.d/auth.conf` with the following variant -- specifying your {CMK} server (here `myserver`) and site (here `mysite`), of course:

.~/etc/apache/conf.d/auth.conf
[{file}]
----
# Set this to the Name of your {CMK} site, e.g.
#Define SITE
Define SITE mysite

# ServerName from listen-ports.conf needs to be overwritten here
# and being set to the URL of the real server. auth_mellon uses this
# to generate the needed URLs in the metadata
ServerName https://myserver

# Load the module.
<IfModule !mod_auth_mellon.c>

	LoadModule auth_mellon_module /omd/sites/${SITE}/lib/apache/modules/mod_auth_mellon.so

</IfModule>

# Only enable this for debugging purposes
#MellonDiagnosticsFile /opt/omd/sites/${SITE}/tmp/mellon_diagnostics.txt
#MellonDiagnosticsEnable On

	# Use SAML auth only in case there is no {CMK} authentication

		RewriteEngine on
		RequestHeader set X-Remote-User "expr=%{REMOTE_USER}"
		RequestHeader edit X-Remote-User "^.*\\\(.*)$" "$1"
		
		# When SAML auth fails, show the login page to the user. This should only happen,
		# if e.g. the mellon cookie is lost/rejected or if the IDP is misconfigured.
		# A failed login at the IDP will not return you here at all.
		
    ErrorDocument 401 '<html> \
      <head> \
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=/${SITE}/check_mk/login.py"> \

	RequestHeader set X-Remote-User "expr=%{REMOTE_USER}"
	RequestHeader edit X-Remote-User "^.*\\\(.*)$" "$1"
	
</Location>
----

Then restart Apache:

[{shell}]
----
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ omd restart apache
----

Last but not least, you now download the dynamically created Mellon metadata as an XML file so that you can import it into AD Management right away:

[{shell-raw}]
----
OMD[mysite]:~/etc/apache/mellon$ wget https://myserver/mysite/mellon/metadata -o metadata.xml
----


==== Configuring Active Directory

To create a Relying Party Trust in ADFS, do the following:

Start the ADFS interface:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_01.png[]

Click [.guihint]#Add Relying Party Trust#:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_02.png[]

Leave the option set to [.guihint]#Claims aware# and continue with the Start button:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_03.png[]

Now select [.guihint]#Import data on the relying party from a file# and specify the XML file you just downloaded:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_04.png[]

You can safely ignore the [.guihint]#AD FS Management# warning:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_05.png[]

Under [.guihint]#Specify Display Name# now enter `{CMK}` as name:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_06.png[]

When assigning permissions, *for testing purposes* you can first select for [.guihint]#Choose Access Control Policy# the value [.guihint]#Permit everyone#; you should later change this to [.guihint]#Permit specific group#.

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_07.png[]

Confirm the summary under [.guihint]#Ready to Add Trust:#

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_08.png[]

Finally, confirm the [.guihint]#Finish# dialog and keep the check mark at [.guihint]#Configure claims issuance policy for this application:#

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_09.png[]

Select the Relying Party Trust you just created and then start the editor with [.guihint]#Edit Claim Issuance Policy... :#

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_10.png[]

Add a new rule in the following dialog via [.guihint]#Add Rule...#:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_11.png[]

In the first step [.guihint]#Select Rule Template# select [.guihint]#Transform to Incoming Claim# and confirm:

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_12.png[]

In the second step [.guihint]#Configure Rule# set the following values:

* [.guihint]#Incoming claim type#: `Windows account name`
* [.guihint]#Outgoing claim type#: `Name ID`
* [.guihint]#Outgoing name ID format#: `Transient Identifier`

[.border]
image::saml_adfs_13.png[]

This also completes the ADFS configuration.
FS can now derive authentication for {CMK} from Windows authentication, which you instruct to authenticate users via HTTP requests in the next step.


==== Configure {CMK}

In {CMK} you now only have to activate under [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global Settings > User Interface > Authenticate users by incoming HTTP requests# at [.guihint]#Current settings# the [.guihint]#Activate HTTP header authentication# option.

image::saml_adfs_cmk.png[]

==== Azure AD with mod_auth_mellon

When Azure AD acts as an IdP, there are some differences in the configuration procedure, for example, the user name can be set directly without being rewritten.

Prerequisites for the following sample configuration:

- Set UserPrincipalName in LDAP connection as identifier (more information at link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-userprincipalname[Microsoft.com^]).
- Custom Enterprise App in Azure AD with UserPrincipalName as 'name' attribute -- more details in the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal[Microsoft documentation^]).

[#migration]
== Migrate existing users
After you have enabled SAML, you can migrate existing users from a password-based connection to the SAML connection.
To do this, check the desired accounts in the user overview under [.guihint]#Setup > users#.
Then start the migration via [.guihint]#Migrate selected users.#

In an intermediate step, you can have any attributes deleted.
