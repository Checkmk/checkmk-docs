:title: The {CMK} user interface
:description: Here you can learn how to use important elements of the graphical user interface (GUI) of {CMK}: navigation bar, main page and sidebar.

[#start_page]
== Start page

In the {CMK} _graphical user interface_ (GUI) you will see some elements that we do not need at this stage.
Many of these are empty, or show zeros, which is because we have not yet included any objects in the monitoring:

ifdef::onprem[]
.The start page of {RE}
image::intro_empty_dashboard.png[alt="{CMK} startpage with 'Main dashboard' still empty."]
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
.The start page of  {CE}
image::intro_empty_dashboard_saas.png[alt="{CMK} startpage with 'Main dashboard' still empty."]
endif::[]

Nevertheless, you should familiarize yourself with the basic elements of the interface.
Most important is the division into the *navigation bar* on the left, the *main page* in the middle, and the *sidebar* on the right.

ifdef::onprem[]
[TIP]
====
The [.guihint]#Main dashboard# shown above with problems and statistics of all hosts and services is that of {RE}.
The commercial editions offer by default a different graph-enhanced xref:dashboards#usage[Main dashboard].
====
endif::[]


[#navigation_bar]
== Navigation bar

include::include_navigation_bar.asciidoc[]


[#main_page]
== Main page

What you see on the main page depends on where you are in {CMK}.
After logging in, you will first see the standard or main xref:intro_tools#dashboards[dashboard], which shows an overview of the current status and recent events on the monitored objects:

ifdef::onprem[]
.The main page with the [.guihint]#Main dashboard# of {RE}
image::intro_mainpage_default.png[alt="{CMK}-Hauptseite mit 'Main dashboard'.",width=94%]
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
.The main page with the [.guihint]#Main dashboard#
image::intro_mainpage_default_saas.png[alt="{CMK}-Hauptseite mit 'Main dashboard'.",width=94%]
endif::[]

The content of the main page changes depending on your selection in the navigation bar and also in the sidebar.
For example, if you select to change your profile in the [.guihint]#User# menu, all profile settings will be displayed on the main page.

Below the current page's title you can see the path to that page, always starting with the name of the menu from the navigation bar.
With the help of this 'breadcrumb navigation' you will always know where you are in {CMK}, even after complex actions, i.e. currently on the [.guihint]#Main dashboard# page in monitoring.


[#sidebar]
== Sidebar

include::include_sidebar.asciidoc[]

By the way, you can get more detailed information on the above-mentioned snap-ins in the xref:intro_tools#[chapter on monitoring tools].


[#show_less_more]
== Show less or Show more

{CMK} provides a wide range of setting and selection options in many places on the interface.
This selection can sometimes be quite overwhelming, so that one can lose sight of the essentials and orientation becomes difficult -- not only, but especially for newcomers to monitoring.

As a measure to reduce complexity, you will find three dots (*...*) in many
locations on the {CMK} interface, such as in the [.guihint]#Overview# or here on the far
right in the first line of the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu:

ifdef::onprem[]
.Three points (...) are used to reduce complexity in {CMK}.
image::intro_monitor_menu_showmore.png[alt="First line of the Monitor menu with search input field and Show more symbol."]
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
.Three points (...) are used to reduce complexity in {CMK}.
image::intro_monitor_menu_showmore_saas.png[alt="First line of the Monitor menu with search input field and Show more symbol."]
endif::[]

Whenever you see these ellipsis points, {CMK} offers two views:
In the 'Show less' mode only the most important entries are shown (meant for the beginner), and in the 'Show more' mode all entries (for the expert).
You can switch between the two modes by clicking on the omission points:
show more with icon:button_showmore[alt="Icon for switching to Show more mode."] and show less with icon:button_showless[alt="Icon for switching to Show less mode."].

You set the general behavior in the settings for your user profile ([.guihint]#User > Edit profile > Show more / Show less > Set custom show mode#) by setting one of the two modes as the default -- or do without both modes and face the unfiltered complexity with [.guihint]#Enforce show more#.


[#search]
== Searching and finding

In the {CMK} interface you will find two central locations for the search -- in the monitoring environment in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, and in the configuration environment in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu.
The input fields for the search terms can be found in the first line of the corresponding menu.

[TIP]
====
As long as you have not yet added a host in the monitoring, the search in the monitoring environment will only return results from the entries in the Monitor menu.
====


[#search_monitor]
=== Searching in the monitoring environment

include::include_searching_in_the_monitoring_environment.asciidoc[]

Apart from the two filters `h:` and `s:` mentioned above, there are others you can use. 
You can find out what these are and how you can also use regular expressions in the xref:user_interface#search_monitor[article on the user interface].


[#search_setup]
=== Searching in the configuration environment

include::include_searching_in_the_configuration_environment.asciidoc[]

The search for rule sets becomes interesting when it comes to xref:intro_finetune#rules[fine-tuning the monitoring] later on, but we are not there yet, because:

xref:intro_setup_monitor#[Continue with the monitoring setup]
