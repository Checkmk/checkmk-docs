[#monitoring]
== Essential monitoring tasks

So you have added hosts and looked at some important tools
-- and now we are ready to start with the actual monitoring.
After all, the whole point of {CMK} is not to be permanently occupied with the configuration, but to provide support for IT operations.

It is true that the views available by default, or e.g. the [.guihint]#Overview# snap-in, already show you very precisely how many and what problems currently exist.
But to model a _workflow_, i.e. 'systematic work procedures' with the monitoring, you need a bit more information on:

* the acknowledgment of problems
* the sending of notifications in the event of problems
* the setting of scheduled downtimes

This chapter only deals with the first and the last of the above points.
The notifications will be covered later in a xref:intro_notifications#[separate chapter], as there are some special preparations that need to be made for this particular subject.


[#ack]
== Acknowledging problems

In the xref:intro_tools#overview[Overview] we have already seen that problems can
be flagged as either _unhandled_ or _handled_. Acknowledging is the very
action that turns an unhandled problem into a handled one. This doesn't necessarily
mean that someone is actually working on the problem. Some problems disappear on
their own. But acknowledging helps to maintain an overview and to establish a workflow.

What exactly happens when a problem is acknowledged?

* In the [.guihint]#Overview# the problem will no longer be counted in the [.guihint]#Unhandled# column at the host or service.
* The dashboards also no longer lists the problem.
* The object (host or service) is marked in views with the icon:icon_ack[alt="Icon for indicating acknowledgment."] symbol.
* An entry is made in the object history so that the action can be later retraced.
* Repeating notifications, if configured, will be stopped.

So how do you acknowledge a problem?

First call up a view that contains the problem.
The easiest way is to use the predefined views in the [.guihint]#Monitor > Problems > Host problems# or [.guihint]#Service problems# menus.
By the way, you can almost get to these more quickly by clicking on the problem count in the [.guihint]#Overview#.

You can click on the problematic host or service in the list and then, on the page with its details, perform the acknowledgment only for this individual host or service.
However, we will stay on the list page because you have all the options here to acknowledge only one problem or several problems at once.

It is not at all uncommon that you would like to acknowledge a number of (related) problems in a single action.
This is easily done by clicking [.guihint]#Show checkboxes# to display a new first column in the list, which contains a checkbox in front of each row.
The checkboxes are all unchecked as the selection is yours -- select the checkbox for each host or service you want to act on.

*Important:* If you perform an action on a page with a list without checkboxes, then this action will be performed for *all* the listed entries.

Now click on [.guihint]#Acknowledge problems#, which will display the following panel at the top of the page:

ifdef::onprem[]
.The dialog for acknowledging problems in {RE}
image::intro_command_acknowledge.png[alt="Dialog for acknowledging problems."]
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
.The dialog for acknowledging problems
image::intro_command_acknowledge_saas.png[alt="Dialog for acknowledging problems."]
endif::[]

Enter a comment and click [.guihint]#Acknowledge problems# -- and with the confirmation of the 'Are you sure?' question{nbsp}...

image::intro_really_acknowledge.png[alt="Confirmation dialog for acknowledgment."]

&#8230; all the selected problems will be flagged as having been acknowledged.

Finally, a couple of tips:

* You can also remove acknowledgments with the [.guihint]#Commands > Remove acknowledgments# menu entry.
* Acknowledgments can run automatically.
ifdef::onprem[]
The [.guihint]#Expire on# option serves this purpose, but it is only available in the commercial editions.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
The [.guihint]#Expire on# option serves this purpose.
endif::[]

For more information on all options for acknowledgment actions, see the xref:basics_ackn#[article on acknowledgment].


[#downtimes]
== Setting up scheduled downtimes

Sometimes things don't 'break' by accident, but rather on purpose -- or to put it a little more carefully, a necessary outage can be tolerated.
After all, every piece of hardware or software needs occasional maintenance, and during such work the respective host or service in the monitoring is very likely to go into the {DOWN} or {CRIT} state.

For those who are supposed to react to problems in {CMK}, it is of course very important that they know about planned downtimes and do not lose valuable time with "false alarms".
To ensure this, {CMK} knows the concept of scheduled downtime (or shorter downtime).

So when an object is due for maintenance, you can set it to the scheduled downtime -- either immediately or for a planned time in the future.

Setting up scheduled downtimes is very similar to the process of acknowledging problems.
You start again with a view containing the desired object (host or service) for which you want to set up a scheduled downtime.
For instance, you can click on the total of hosts or services in the [.guihint]#Overview# to get a list of all objects.

In the list that is displayed, use [.guihint]#Show checkboxes# to show the checkboxes and then select all the appropriate entries.

Now click [.guihint]#Schedule downtimes#.
This will display the following panel at the top of the page:

ifdef::onprem[]
.The dialog for the scheduled downtime of a host in {RE}
image::intro_command_downtime.png[alt="Dialog for defining a scheduled downtime."]
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
.The dialog for the scheduled downtime of a host
image::intro_command_downtime_saas.png[alt="Dialog for defining a scheduled downtime."]
endif::[]

There is a whole range of options for the scheduled downtimes.
You must enter a comment in each case.
There are numerous different options for defining the time range -- from the simple [.guihint]#2 hours#, which defines the downtime *immediately*, 
to the specification of an explicit time range, which can also be used to define a downtime in the future.
In contrast to the acknowledgments, scheduled downtimes will always have an end time that is set beforehand.

Here are a couple of more tips:

* When you schedule a host for a downtime, all of its services are automatically scheduled as well, thus saving yourself the work of having to do this twice.

* The *flexible* scheduled downtimes actually only commence when the object changes to a state other than {OK}.

ifdef::onprem[]
* If you use one of the commercial editions, you can also define *regular* scheduled downtimes -- for instance, for a mandatory reboot once a week.
endif::[]
ifdef::saas[]
* You can also define *regular* scheduled downtimes -- for instance, for a mandatory reboot once a week.
endif::[]

* You can get an overview of any currently ongoing scheduled downtimes in [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > Scheduled downtimes#.

The effects of a scheduled downtime are as follows:

* In the [.guihint]#Overview# the affected hosts and services no longer appear as having problems.
* In views, the selected host or service is marked with the icon:icon_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying a scheduled downtime."] guiding cone.
If a host with all its services is sent to downtime, the services get the icon:icon_derived_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying a derived scheduled downtime for a service."] icon with server and small guiding cone.
* For these objects the notification of problems is switched off during scheduled downtime.
* A special notification is triggered at the beginning and at the end of a downtime period.
* In the xref:availability#[availability analysis] planned scheduled downtimes are accounted for separately.

For a detailed description of all the above-mentioned and other aspects, see the xref:basics_downtimes#[article on scheduled downtimes].
