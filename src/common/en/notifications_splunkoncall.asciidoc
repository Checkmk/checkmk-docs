{related-end}


The incident management platform link:https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/on-call.html[Splunk On-Call^] handles the distribution of messages from dozens of different sources,
which can be selected as integrations directly in the web interface.
A generic REST API back-end is available for {CMK}.


[#config_splunkoncall]
== Configuring Splunk On-Call

You do not need to explicitly activate the notifications from {CMK}, only the REST API endpoint address:

. In Splunk On-Call under [.guihint]#Integrations#, call the [.guihint]#REST Generic# item.
. Copy the displayed REST API endpoint URL.


[#config_checkmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

In {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the URL copied above:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Splunk On-Call#.
. Enter the copied URL under [.guihint]#REST Endpoint URL#:

+
Instead of entering the URL directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI within the notification.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notifications#notification_testing[notifications].
