:title: Extending the monitoring system further
:description: Examples to expand monitoring with {CMK} after setup are: optimizing security, monitoring very large environments and using Business Intelligence (BI).

[#security]
== Optimizing security

Even if monitoring is 'only' observation, the matter of IT security is still very important, especially when connecting and setting up remote systems.
In the xref:security#[article on security] you will find an overview of topics with which you can optimize the security of your system.


[#distributed_monitoring]
== Monitoring very large environments

When your monitoring reaches a scale where you are monitoring thousands or even more hosts, questions of architecture and optimization become more urgent.
One of the most important issues is xref:glossar#distributed_monitoring[distributed monitoring].
Here you work with several {CMK} sites that are interconnected to form a large system and which can be configured centrally in xref:glossar#central_setup[central setup] if required.

[#availability]
== Availability and SLAs

{CMK} can calculate very precisely how high the xref:availability#[availability] of hosts or services was within certain time frames, how many outages there were, how long such outages continued, and much more.

ifdef::onprem[]
Based on the availability data, the xref:sla#[SLA] software module included in the commercial editions enables a much more detailed evaluation for aid in complying with service level agreements -- and such agreements can even be actively monitored.

[#inventory]
== Hardware and software inventory

The xref:inventory#[hardware/software inventory] is actually no longer a part of monitoring, but {CMK} can use the already existing xref:glossar#agent[agents] to generate extensive information on the hardware and software in your monitored systems.
This is very helpful for maintenance, license management or the automatic filling of configuration management databases.

ifdef::onprem[]
[#ec]
== Monitoring messages and events

So far we have only dealt with monitoring the current states of hosts and services.
A completely different matter is the evaluation of spontaneous messages that appear for instance in log files or which are sent via the syslog or SNMP traps.
{CMK} filters relevant events from the incoming messages, and has a completely integrated system called the xref:ec#[Event Console] for this purpose.

[#nagvis]
== Visualization using maps and diagrams

With the integrated xref:nagvis#[NagVis] add-on in {CMK}, you can display states on customized maps or diagrams.
This is excellent for creating appealing general overviews, such as on a monitor in a control room.

endif::[]


[#bi]
== Business Intelligence (BI)

With the xref:glossar#bi[Business Intelligence] software module integrated in {CMK}, you can derive the overall status of business-critical applications from the many individual status data and display these clearly.

[#reporting]
== Creating PDF reports

The information available in {CMK} -- views, availability tables, graphs, logos, and much more -- can be compiled into xref:reporting#[reports] and exported as printable PDF documents.
ifdef::onprem[]
PDF reports can only be created in the commercial editions.
endif::[]


[#agent_updater]
== Automated updating of the agents

ifdef::onprem[]
If you monitor many Linux and Windows servers, you can use the xref:agent_deployment#[Agent Updater] included in the commercial editions to have a centralized method for keeping your monitoring agents and their configurations up to date.

ifdef::onprem[]
[#devel]
== Developing your own plug-ins

Even though {CMK} offers over 2000 check plug-ins, it can still sometimes be that a specific plug-in is missing.
An introduction to the development of extensions for {CMK} can be found in an xref:devel_intro#[own article].

== Extending {CMK}

Even though {CMK} offers over 2000 check plug-ins, it can still sometimes be that a specific function is missing.
