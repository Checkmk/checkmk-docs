The link:https://www.pagerduty.com[PagerDuty^] incident management platform can receive messages from a wide variety of sources and process them further -- for example by filtering, sending notifications or initiating escalations.
Notifications from {CMK} can be forwarded to the platform via a key.


[#config_pagerduty]
== Configuring PagerDuty

PagerDuty provides integrations for many popular tools, including {CMK}.
All you need is an _integration key_, which you create under PagerDuty as follows:

. Create a new service or open an existing one.
. In the corresponding service create a new integration via the [.guihint]#Integrations# tab.
. Assign any name and for the [.guihint]#Integration Type# choose [.guihint]#Check_MK#.
. Copy the created [.guihint]#Integration Key#.


[#config_checkmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

In {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the key copied above:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#PagerDuty#.
. Enter the copied key under [.guihint]#Integration Key#:

Instead of entering the key directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:

The filtering of the generated notifications can be implemented either in {CMK}, or in PagerDuty via the [.guihint]#Event Rules#.
You can also optionally switch the PagerDuty connection to your own {CMK} user account.
Simply create a standard user with a disabled login, and then create a personal notification rule.

ifdef::saas[]
The filtering of the generated notifications can be implemented in PagerDuty via the [.guihint]#Event Rules#.

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notifications#notification_testing[notifications].
