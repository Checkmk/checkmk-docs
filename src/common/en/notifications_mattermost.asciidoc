link:https://mattermost.com[Mattermost^] is the self-hosted open-source alternative to Slack, which can also be provided with notifications via webhook.

== Configuring Mattermost

If you have just set up the Mattermost server, webhooks will already be active.
However you can also enable them later in the Mattermost [.guihint]#System Console# -- i.e. the server's administration interface -- under [.guihint]#Integrations > Integration Management#.

Another prerequisite is that you have at least one group -- otherwise you will not be able to access the web client view at all.
Proceed as follows:

. In the group view, open [.guihint]#Integrations# from the main menu.
. Create a new webhook via [.guihint]#Incoming Webhooks > Add Incoming Webhook#.
. Enter a name and description as required, and select the channel for the postings with the notifications.

With these actions the webhook URL will be generated.
Copy this URL for use in the next step.


[#config_checkmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

As with xref:notifications_slack#[Slack], in {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the URL copied above:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Slack or Mattermost#.
. Enter the copied webhook URL:

+
Instead of entering the URL directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI within the notification.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notifications#notification_testing[notifications].
