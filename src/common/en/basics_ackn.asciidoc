== Introduction

For the problems {DOWN}, {UNREACH}, {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN} {CMK} distinguishes two possible states: *unhandled* and icon:icon_ack[] *handled*.
A handled (acknowledged) problem indicates that the issue is known and that somebody is attending to it.

If a problem has been acknowledged, then...

* ... it will be identified with a icon:icon_ack[] symbol,
* ... it will no longer appear as [.guihint]#Unhandled# in the xref:user_interface#overview[Overview] snap-in,
* ... no further xref:notifications#[notifications] will be sent.

Additionally, problems can be systematically identified in views as being acknowledged or unacknowledged via the icon:icon_filter[alt="Icon for displaying the filter bar."] filter [.guihint]#Problem acknowledged#.


== The Acknowledgement procedure

Problems are acknowledged via xref:commands#[commands] on the affected hosts/services.
Acknowledgements can be removed in the same way.

Advice for these options:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|[.guihint]#Comment# |You can include a URL such as `pass:[https://www.example.com]` in this field, which will be replaced by a clickable link.
|[.guihint]#Expire on# |Commercial editions: With this option you can set a validity period for the acknowledgement. Once the set time has been reached, the acknowledgement is automatically deleted, even if the host/service does not go back to {OK} or {UP}.
|[.guihint]#Ignore status changes until services/hosts are OK/UP again (sticky)# |An acknowledgement is normally valid until the *next status change*. If for example, a service has been acknowledged with a {WARN} status, and later changes to {CRIT}, the acknowledgement will be automatically-removed. Activating [.guihint]#sticky# will retain the acknowledgement until an {OK} or an {UP} status is received.
|[.guihint]#Keep comment after acknowledgment expires (persistent comment)# |With this option your commentary will not be automatically deleted if the acknowledgement disappears or is removed. Commentaries entered in this way must be manually deleted later (see the end of this chapter).
|[.guihint]#Notify affected users if notification rules are in place (send notifications)# |All contacts assigned to the host/service whom are configured to be notified for the [.guihint]#Acknowledgement of host/service problem# will be sent a notification.
|===

You can permanently change the default settings for these options via [.guihint]#Edit defaults#.
These settings are also available via [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > User interface > Acknowledge problems#.


== Acknowledgements in the GUI

In the {CMK} web interface there are several possibilities for displaying
acknowledgements.

In all host and service views, acknowledged problems are identified by
two symbols:

[cols=2]
|===
|icon:icon_ack[] |This symbol identifies an acknowledgement
|icon:icon_comment[] |Clicking on this symbol displays a list with any acknowledgement comments.
|===

Via [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > Comments# you can view a list of all comments for hosts and services -- including those created through acknowledgements.
Comments may be deleted with xref:commands#[commands].
// SK: The following sentence might have just been a misunderstanding or unfortunate wording. I will remove it for the time being.
// Deleting a comment has no effect on logged acknowledgements.
