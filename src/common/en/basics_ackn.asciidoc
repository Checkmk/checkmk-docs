[#intro]
== Introduction

For the problems {DOWN}, {UNREACH}, {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN} {CMK} distinguishes two possible states: *unhandled* and icon:icon_ack[alt="Icon of an acknowledgment."] *handled*.
A handled (acknowledged) problem indicates that the issue is known and that somebody is attending to it.

If a problem has been acknowledged, then...

* ... it will be identified with a icon:icon_ack[alt="Icon of an acknowledgment."] icon,
* ... it will no longer appear as [.guihint]#Unhandled# in the xref:user_interface#overview[Overview] snap-in,
* ... no further xref:glossar#notification[notifications] will be sent.

Additionally, problems can be systematically identified in views as being acknowledged or unacknowledged via the icon:icon_filter[alt="Icon for displaying the filter bar."] filter [.guihint]#Problem acknowledged#.


[#procedure]
== The acknowledgment procedure

Problems are acknowledged via xref:commands#[commands] on the affected hosts/services.
Acknowledgments can be removed in the same way.

ifdef::onprem[]
.Confirmation dialog before executing an acknowledgment in the commercial editions
endif::[]
image::basics_ackn_acknowledge.png[alt="Confirmation dialog before executing an acknowledgment."]

Advice for these options:

[cols="30,~"]
|===

|[.guihint]#Comment# |You can include a URL such as `pass:[https://www.example.com]` in this field, which will be replaced by a clickable link.

|[.guihint]#Expire on# |
ifdef::onprem[]
Commercial editions:
endif::[]
With this option you can set a validity period for the acknowledgment.
When the specified time has been reached, the acknowledgment is automatically deleted, even if the host/service does not go back to {OK} or {UP}.

|[.guihint]#Ignore status changes until services/hosts are OK/UP again (sticky)# |An acknowledgment is normally valid until the *next   change*.
If for example, a service has been acknowledged with a {WARN} status, and later changes to {CRIT}, the acknowledgment will be automatically-removed.
Activating this option will retain the acknowledgment until the {OK} or {UP} status is reached.

|[.guihint]#Keep comment after acknowledgment expires (persistent comment)# |With this option your comment will not be automatically deleted if the acknowledgment disappears or is removed.
Comments created in this way must be deleted manually later as described in the xref:gui[next chapter].

|[.guihint]#Notify affected users if notification rules are in place (send notifications)# |Triggers notifications of type `ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` to all contacts of the host/service .
So your colleagues know about it.
|===

You can permanently change the default settings for these options via [.guihint]#Edit defaults#.
These settings are also available via [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > User interface > Acknowledge problems#.


[#gui]
== Acknowledgments in the GUI

In the {CMK} web interface there are several possibilities for displaying acknowledgments.

In all host and service views, acknowledged problems are identified by two icons:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|icon:icon_ack[alt="Icon of an acknowledgment."] |This icon identifies an acknowledgment
|icon:icon_comment[alt="Icon of a comment."] |Clicking on this icon displays a list with any acknowledgment comments.
|===

Via [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > Comments# you can view a list of all comments for hosts and services -- including those created through acknowledgments.
Comments can also be deleted on the [.guihint]#Comments# page.
