[#intro]
== Introduction

{CMK} allows you to comprehensively monitor Microsoft SQL Server.
A complete list of the monitoring options can be found in our in our link:https://checkmk.com/integrations?tags=mssql[Catalog of check plug-ins].
Among other things, {CMK} can monitor the following values:

* link:https://checkmk.com/integrations/mssql_instance[MS SQL: General State^]

To be able to monitor the databases, you only need the agent plug-in in addition to the {CMK} agent.
No additional software is required on either the {CMK} or the database server.
