description:
 "Hello world!" is an example package primarily built for the purpose
 of showcasing minimal contents of a valid, usable package that can
 be uploaded to the CheckMK exchange. 

 Expected agent output:

 <<<hello_world>>>
 
 hello_world 57.74685569821927

 The float is expected to be in the range between 0% and 100%. The
 sample agent relies on these four lines Python, store it as
 /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/helloworld and make sure it is 
 set executable. 

 Sample agent script (included)

 #!/usr/bin/env python3
 
 from random import random
 
 print("<<<hello_world>>>")
 
 print("hello_world", random() * 100.0)

 In default settings, above 80% "hellolevel" the state changes from
 OK -> WARNING, issueing the message "Hello, I need some coffee!",
 above 90%, the state will be CRIT "Hello, leave me alone!".  
 
 Feel free to use the files contained in this MKP as a foundation for
 your first proper CheckMK plugin.
