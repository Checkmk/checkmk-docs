== Introduction

image::example_graph.png[]

Alongside the actual system monitoring -- namely, the detection of problems --
{CMK} is an excellent tool for the recording and analysis of the diverse
performance data which can be generated in IT environments. These can include,
for example:

* Operating system performance (disk IO, CPU and storage utilisation, ...)
* Network statistics (utilised bandwidth, packet tranfer times, error rates, ...)
* Environment sensors (temperature, humidity, air pressure, ...)
* Usage statistics (logged-in users, page requests, sessions, ...)
* Quality indicators from applications (e.g., website response times)
* Electricity consumption and quality in a data centre (currents, voltages, performances, battery capacities, ...)
* Application-specific data (e.g., length of mail queues from MS Exchange)
* _and much more..._

{CMK} records all measurements generated by the monitoring over a period
(adjustable) of four years, so that it can not only access the current data, but
also historic data. In order to keep disk space usage under control, older data
is compressed. The actual performance data itself is detected by the individual
Check Plug-ins. These plug-ins also determine exactly which values are provided.


== Access via the GUI

A service’s performance data is presented in three different forms in the GUI.
The so-called *Perf-O-Meter* appears directly in a host’s or service’s
tables and provides a quick overview and a visual comparison. These are however
usually limited by space to a selected single metric. For file systems, for
example, this is the percentage of space used:

[{image-border}]
image::perfometer_filesystems.png[]

You can view all of a service’s metrics in a *time range* -- either by
moving the cursor over the icon:icon_pnp[] graphs icon, or by clicking on it.
The same graphs can also be very easily found in a host’s or service’s details:

image::graph_used_cpu_time.png[]

*A table with the precise current performance data* for all metrics can
also be found in a host’s or service’s details:

image::metrics_table.png[]

How precisely the time ranges are displayed depends on your {CMK} edition:


== The {EE}’s graphing

{cee-only}
The {CEE} include a completely
newly-developed, self-contained interface for the visualisation of historic
performance data, based on interactive HTML5. Additionally there is a native
presentation in PDF -- directly as a vector graphic in PDF format in fact -- and
thus without visible pixels when printed.


=== Interaction with the graphs

You can interactively influence the displaying of graphs in various ways:

* By panning -- click and hold the left mouse button and drag the time range (left/right), or scale it vertically (up/down)
* Using the mouse-wheel to zoom in or out of the time range
* By dragging the graph’s lower right corner to change its size
* Clicking on a position in a graph sets a _pin_. In this way you can identify a point’s exact time and all of the precise performance data for this moment. The pin’s exact time is saved for each user, and displayed in all graphs:

image::graphing_pin.png[]

If a page includes several graphs, all of the graphs conform to changes made to
the time range and the pin -- thus the values can always be compared across graphs.
Likewise, scaling is effected on all of the graphs. These readjustments however first appear with a
page refresh (otherwise there could be chaos on the display at times...)

As soon as you use the interactive functions -- such as setting a pin -- a
large ‘pause’ symbol appears on the screen and the page refresh stops for
60 seconds. This means that your changes in the graph are not immediately
reversed by the refresh. The countdown is always reset to 60 seconds when
you become active again. You are also able to pause the countdown completely
by clicking the number. The pause symbol allows you to end the pause directly in any case.

image::graphing_pause.png[]


[#graph_collections]
== Graph Collections

With the icon:icon_menu[] menu symbol you can embed graphs in various
displays -- in reports or dashboards for example. [.guihint]#Graph Collections# are very useful
here. In such a graph collection you can pack as many graphs as desired and
later compare or export them as PDFs. By default every user has a graph
collection named [.guihint]#My Graphs#. You can very easily add new ones, and even make
them visible to other users. The procedure is exactly the same as that for link:views.html[views].

You access your graph collection via [.guihint]#Views > Metrics > My Graphs#
in the sidebar. The [.guihint]#My Graphs# entry only appears if you have actually added
at least one graph to that collection.

image::snapin_graph_collections.png[width=50%]

The icon:button_graph_collections[] button opens the table listing
all of your graph collections, and enables you to add new ones, to modify existing ones, etc.


[#custom_graphs]
== Custom graphs

The {CEE} provide a graphic-editor with which you can create your own complete graphs with their
own calculation formulae. With this it is now also possible to combine values
*from different hosts and services into a single graph*.You access the
custom graphs, e.g. via [.guihint]#Views > EDIT#, and then with the
icon:button_custom_graphs[] button.

An alternative method is via a service’s metrics table. Here a
icon:icon_custom_graph[] graphs icon is available for each metric -- so that you
can add the metric to a custom graph:

image::graphing_new_custom.png[]

The following image shows a list of the custom graphs (here with only a single entry):

[{image-border}]
image::custom_graph_list.png[]

There are five possible operations for every existing graph:

[cols=2]
|===

|icon:icon_new_custom_graph[] |Views this graph.
|icon:icon_insert[] |Creates a copy of this graph.
|icon:icon_delete[] |Deletes this graph.
|icon:icon_edit[] |Opens this graph’s *general characteristics*.   Here, as well as the graph’s title, you can also define its   visibility for other users. All of these function in exactly the same way as with   link:views.html[views]. Remember the online help icon:icon_help[] if you have   questions regarding these settings.
|icon:icon_custom_graph[] |Here you can access the actual graph designer, in which the graph’s content can be modified.
|===


Note that every custom graph -- like the views -- has a unique ID. This ID
is addressed in reports and dashboards. If you later change a graph’s ID these
links will be broken. All graphs that are not [.guihint]#hidden# are displayed under
[.guihint]#Views > Metrics# in the sidebar.


=== The Graph Designer

[{image-border}]
image::custom_graphs.png[]

The graph designer is divided into four sections:


=== Graph preview

Here you can see the graph exactly as it will be seen live. You can also use all
of its interactive functions.


=== Metrics list

Curves included in the graphs can be directly-edited here. Modifying a
curve’s title in this field is confirmed with the ‘Enter’ key. The [.guihint]#Style#
defines how the values in graphs are displayed. Here are the possible options:

[cols=2]
|===

|[.guihint]#Line# |The value will be drawn as a line
|[.guihint]#Area# |The value will be drawn as an area. Be aware that curves positioned higher in the list have priority over and could cover later ones. If you wish to combine lines and areas, the areas should always be positioned below the lines.
|[.guihint]#Stacked Area# |All curves with this style will be drawn as areas and stacked according to their values (in effect added). The upper limit of this stack therefore symbolises the sum of all of the curves in the graph.
|===


The three further options -- [.guihint]#Mirrored Line#, [.guihint]#Mirrored Area# and
[.guihint]#Mirrored Stacked# are similar, except that the curves are drawn downwards
from the zero line. This enables a style of graph such as generally used by
{CMK} in input/output graphs for the following:

image::graph_input_output.png[]

In the last column of the metrics table you can edit existing metrics. This
allows you to, e.g., simply clone icon:button_clone[] a curve and then just
substitute the old host name for a new one. The meanings of the individual fields will be
explained in the next section.


[#adding_metrics]
=== Adding metrics using the Metrics function

With the [.guihint]#Metrics# function you can add new metrics to graphs. As soon as you
enter a valid host name in the first field, the second field will be filled with
a list of the host’s services. Making a selection in this list will fill the
third field with a list of this service’s metrics. In the fourth and last field,
select the *consolidation function*. Here the options are [.guihint]#Minimum#,
[.guihint]#Maximum# and [.guihint]#Average#. These functions are used when the data stored in
the RRDs for the specified time range is already compressed. In a range where,
e.g., only one value per half hour is available, you can choose to plot the
minimum, maximum, or average original measured value for this time range.

image::graphing_metrics.png[]

In the same way, you can use the function [.guihint]#Add new scalar# to display the
values of a service for {WARN}, {CRIT}, maximum and minimum as a horizontal line.

image::graphing_scalar.png[]

You can also add a *constant* to the graph. This will initially be drawn as
a horizontal line. Constants are sometimes required to generate calculation
formulae. More on this later.


=== Graph options

Here you can find options that affect complete graphs. [.guihint]#Unit# influences the
labelling of the axes and legends. It will be set automatically when the first
metric is added. Note that it is possible, but not advisable, to add two metrics
with differing units to a single graph.

With [.guihint]#Explicit vertical range# you can predefine a graph’s vertical axis. The
Y-axis is normally scaled so that all values in the chosen time range fit
exactly in the graph. If you create a graph for, e.g. percentage values, you can
choose to always display the values from 0 to 100. Note though, that users (and
you yourself) can in any case scale a graph using the mouse, making the
positioning ineffective.


[#calculation]
=== Calculating with formulae

The graph designer makes it possible for you to combine the individual curves
using calculations. The following example shows a graph with two curves: CPU
utilisation, for [.guihint]#User# and [.guihint]#System#.

Let’s assume that for this graph, you are only interested in the sum of the two
curves. For this you check the selection boxes for both curves. When this is
done, in the [.guihint]#Metrics# panel on the row [.guihint]#Operation on selected metrics#
a few new buttons will have appeared for all the eligigle operations:

[{image-border}]
image::graphdesigner_ops_1.png[]

Clicking on [.guihint]#Sum# will combine both curves into a new curve. This new curve’s
colour will automatically be a mixture of the colours of the two input curves.
The new curve will be titled [.guihint]#Sum of User, System#. The formula used for the
calculation will be shown in the [.guihint]#Formula# column. In addition a new
icon:button_dissolve_operation[] symbol will appear:

[{image-border}]
image::graphdesigner_ops_2.png[]

Clicking on icon:button_dissolve_operation[] works as an ‘undo’, with
which the original individual curves can again be displayed. Further tips for
calculation operations:

* It is sometimes sensible to include constants, e.g., to subtract a curve’s value from the number 100.
* Scalars can be used for calculations.
* The operations can be nested in any order.


== The PNP4Nagios graphic interface

{cre-only}
The graphing system in the {CRE} is generated by
link:http://www.pnp4nagios.org[PNP4Nagios von Jörg Linge] as a basis for
the capturing and visualisation of performance data. This is an independent
project written in the PHP language and which can also be used without {CMK}. It
is popular mainly with users of conventional Nagios-based monitoring systems.
PNP4Nagios is integrated in the {CMK} display via a frame and its colours have
been matched to {CMK} as well:

[{image-border}]
image::graphingpnp.png[]


=== Selecting a time range

You have various possibilities for choosing the time range to be displayed:

* Using the mouse you can select a range directly in a graph
* The icon:pnp_zoom[] magnifying glass opens a dialogue with buttons for scrolling and zooming
* The icon:pnp_calendar[] calendar enables the entry of dates and times
* In the [.guihint]#Timeranges# menu you can select from five standard time ranges (e.g. [.guihint]#One Month#)


=== The Basket

With the icon:pnp_add[] icon in your [.guihint]#Basket# you can ‘collect’ multiple
graphs for later simultaneous viewing via [.guihint]#My basket#. You can likewise
simultaneously view and more easily compare graphs from various hosts.


=== PDF export

The icon:pnp_pdf[] button allows the current display to be easily exported as a PDF.


[#graphing_api]
== Graphite, Grafana and InfluxDB

{cee-only}
When you install one of the {CEE}, in addition to {CMK}’s own built-in
graphing you can also link external metrics data bases in parallel. The {CMK}
Micro Core can additionally send all performance data to one or mutiple data
bases that supports the link:http://graphite.wikidot.com/[Graphite]
protocol. Alongside Graphite itself, link:https://influxdata.com/[InfluxDB]
for example also has such an interface.

The connection is configured in [.guihint]#Global Settings# under
[.guihint]#Send metrics to Graphite / InfluxDB#:

image::graphite.png[]

Alongside the obvious network information, here you can also optionally
configure a prefix to be appended to every host name in order to, for example,
force the use of explicite names. HOST.SERVICE.METRIK is used as the naming
schema for the metric export.

If a connection doesn’t function, diagnostic information can be found in the
instance’s `~/var/log/cmc.log` file. The following example shows the messages in the
case of an unsuccessful connection to a Graphite-Server:

./omd/sites/mysite/var/log/cmc.log
[{file}]
----
2016-02-24 16:30:48 [5] Successfully initiated connection to Carbon/Graphite at 10.0.0.5:2003.
2016-02-24 16:32:57 [4] Connection to Carbon/Graphite at 10.0.0.5:2003 failed: Connection timed out
2016-02-24 16:32:57 [5] Closing connection to Carbon/Graphite at 10.0.0.5:2003
----

In such situations the core automatically makes repeated attempts to build the
connection. During the time the connection to Graphite is down, any performance data generated is not
buffered and is therefore lost. (or is only available in {CMK}’s
RRD-data base).


== Historical performance data in tables

=== What is this about?

(NEW) If you look at past performance data you are sometimes not interested in
the exact details of their progress over a time period. Just a rough summary may
be of more interest, e.g. _The average CPU consumption over the last 7
days_. The result in this example would simply be a number like _88%_.

This function is available since Version {v16} of {CMK}.
In a table of hosts or services, you can add columns that represent the number,
average, maximum, or other summaries of a metric over a period of time.
This feature also enables you to create reports that sort by these columns,
e.g. display the list of those ESX-Hosts that had the lowest utilization in the
selected period.


=== Adding performance data to tables

To obtain such measured values, proceed as follows:

. Select or create a view to which you want to add the column.
. Add a column of the type [.guihint]#Services: Historic metrics#.


==== Creating a view

First you need a view to which you want to add columns. This can be a view of
either _hosts_ or of _services_. For details on creating or editing
views, see the link:views.html#edit[article on views].

In the following example I made a copy of the view [.guihint]#All hosts#, and removed
the columns for the number of services in the different states.
So that the existing [.guihint]#All hosts# view will not be replaced by the new view,
I have given the (new) view's ID a new name.

[{image-border}]
image::graphing_historic_metrics_1.png[]
//BI:historic_metrics_1.png


==== Adding columns

Now add a column of the type [.guihint]#Services: Historic metrics#. Since this is a
column of services, in the case of a host view you need the column type
[.guihint]#Joined column# as the first selection, which enables the display of a service
column in a host table. With a service view, it is sufficient to add a new
[.guihint]#Column#.

Then select [.guihint]#Services: Historic metrics# as a new column.

//BI:historic_metrics_2.png center width:85%
[{image-border}]
image::graphing_historic_metrics_2.png[]

In [.guihint]#Metric name# select the name of the metric that is to be
historically-evaluated. If you are unsure of the metric's name, you can find
this in the service details at the entry [.guihint]#Service Metrics#:

[{image-border}]
image::graphing_historic_metrics_4.png[]

In my example I chose the metric [.guihint]#CPU utilization#, which
*also happens to be* the same as the name of the service.

With [.guihint]#RRD consolition# it is best to choose the same value as that used below
in the [.guihint]#Aggregation function#, since it would make little sense to calculate
things like 'the minimum of the maximum'.

The [.guihint]#Time range# is the time period in the past which you want to investigate.
In my example, I chose the last seven days, which is exactly 168 hours.

[.guihint]#Column title# is the name for the new column -- added to the headings shown
at the top of the table. I used `Util @ 7 days` in my example.
Please don't be surprised that a field with the name [.guihint]#Title# appears
later -- you will only see this if a [.guihint]#Joined column# is used here,
which always allows the specification of a title.
Just leave the second title blank.

After saving, you will now see a view with an added column that shows the
percentage of CPU usage over the past seven days.
Here is an example of the host view:

//BI:historic_metrics_3.png
[{image-border}]
image::graphing_historic_metrics_3.png[]

*Notes*

* You can of course also add multiple columns in this way, e.g. for different metrics or different time periods.
* When specifying the service, note the exact spelling (including upper case/lower case).
* For hosts that do not have the relevant metric or service, the field simply remains empty.
* If you work with a table of services, you don't need [.guihint]#joined columns#. However, you can only display one service per host in each row.

[#rrds]
== Background, tuning, fault diagnosis

{CMK} stores all data in specially-developed data bases, the so-called
*RRDs* (*Round Robin Data bases*). Here the
link:http://www.rrdtool.org[RRDTool from Tobi Oetiker] can be used,
which is very popular and widely-used for open-source projects.

The RRDs offer important advantages for the storage of performance data in comparison to classic
SQL data bases:

* RRDs store data very compactly and efficiently.
* The space used per metric on the drive is static. RRDs can neither grow nor shrink. The required disk space can be planned well.
* The CPU and disk time per update is always the same. RRDs are (virtually) real-time capable, so that reorganisations can’t cause data jams.


=== Organisation of data in RRDs

By default {CMK} is configured so that the performance of every metric is
recorded over a *four year* time range. The base resolution used is one
minute. This makes sense as the check interval is preset at one minute, so
that precisely once per minute new data will be received from every service.

Obviously, storing one value per minute over a four-year period will require an
enormous amount of drive space (although the RRDs require only 8 bytes per
measured value). For this reason, over time the data is *compressed*. The
first compression is at 48 hours. From this time only one value will be stored
every five minutes. Further stages are after 10 days and 90 days:

[cols=4]
|===
|Phase |Duration |Resolution |Measuring points 

|1 |2 days |1 minute |2880
|2 |10 days |5 minutes |2880
|3 |90 days |30 minutes |4320
|4 |4 years |6 hours |5840
|===


The obvious question now is -- how best to consolidate five values meaningfully
into one? For this the *consolidation functions* -- *maximum*,
*minimum* and *average* are available. What is meaningful in
practice depends on the application or point of view. If, for example, you wish
to monitor the temperature fluctuations in a processing centre over a four-year
period, the maximum temperature recorded is probably of most interest. For an
application’s access rates an average could be of more interest.

To achieve the maximum flexibility for later calculations, {CMK}’s RRDs are simply
preset to store *all three* values at once -- minimum, maximum _and_
average. For each compression level and consolidation function the RRD
includes a ‘ring’ style of storage -- a so-called RRA (Round Robin Archive). In
the standard structure there are 12 RRAs. The standard structure for {CMK}
therefore requires 384,952 bytes per metric. This number is derived from: 2880 + 2880 + 4320 + 5840
measurement points, times three consolidation functions,
times 8 bytes per measured value -- which gives a total of exactly 382,080
bytes. Adding the file header of 2872 bytes gives the final size of 384,952
bytes quoted above.

An interesting alternative schema would be, for exmple, to store one value per minute
for an entire year. This method would have a small advantage: the RRDs would at
all times have the optimal resolution, and could thereby dispense with
consolidation and, only generate _average_ value for example. Calculating 365 x
24 x 60 measurement points, times 8 bytes, the result is a total of almost
exactly 4 MB per metric. In this way although the RRDs have a tenfold storage
requirement, the *disk IO* is actually reduced! The reason is that it is no
longer necessary to store and update in twelve separate RRAs, instead only one
is needed.


=== Customising the RRD structure

{cee-only}
If the predefined storage scheme does not suit you, it can be altered via
the link:wato_rules.html[configuration rules] (and even different versions per host
or service are possible). The required rules set can be most easily found
via the rules search -- thus [.guihint]#WATO > Host & Service Parameters > Search for rules sets#
-- and once there simply enter [.guihint]#RRD#. Here you will find the rule
[.guihint]#Configuration of RRD databases of services#. There is also a similar rule
for hosts, but hosts have performance data only in exceptional cases.
The image below shows the RRD rule with its default settings:

image::graphing_rrd_configuration.png[]

In the [.guihint]#Consolidation Functions# and [.guihint]#RRA Configuration# submenus you can
define and set the number and size of the compression phases ready for use by
consolidations. The [.guihint]#Step# field defines the resolution in seconds, and as a
rule it is 60 seconds (one minute). For services with a check interval of less than a
minute it can be sensible to set this number lower. Note however that the value
in the [.guihint]#Number of steps aggregated into one data point# field will no longer
represent minutes, but instead the time interval set in [.guihint]#Step#.

{cee-only}
Every change to the RRD structure initially has an effect only on
*newly created* RRDs -- that is to say, on hosts or services
newly-incorporated into the monitoring. You can also allow {CMK} to
restructure existing RRDs. This is performed by the `cmk --convert-rrds`
command, with which the `-v` (verbose) option is always available.
{CMK} will then inspect all existing RRDs and restructure them as needed
into the defined target format:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -v --convert-rrds
myserver012:
   Uptime (CMC).....converted, 376 KB -> 159 KB
   Filesystem / (CMC).....converted, 1873 KB -> 792 KB
   OMD slave apache (CMC).....converted, 14599 KB -> 6171 KB
   Memory (CMC).....converted, 14225 KB -> 6012 KB
   Filesystem /home/mk (CMC).....converted, 1873 KB -> 792 KB
   Interface 2 (CMC).....converted, 4119 KB -> 1741 KB
   CPU load (CMC).....converted, 1125 KB -> 475 KB
----

The command is intelligent enough to recognise RRDs that already have the
desired structure:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -v --convert-rrds
myserver345:
   Uptime (CMC).....uptodate
   Filesystem / (CMC).....uptodate
   OMD slave apache (CMC).....uptodate
   Memory (CMC).....uptodate
   Filesystem /home/mk (CMC).....uptodate
   Interface 2 (CMC).....uptodate
   CPU load (CMC).....uptodate
----

If the new format has a higher resolution or extra consolidation functions, the
existing data will be interpolated as best it can be so that the RRDs will
contain the most meaningful values possible. It is however naturally obvious
that if, for example, instead of 2 days, you now require 5 days with values at
one minute intervals, then the accuracy of the existing data cannot be
retroactively increased.


[#rrdformat]
=== The RRD storage format

{cee-only}
The rule described above has a further setting: [.guihint]#RRD storage format#.
With this you can choose between two methods that {CMK} can use when
creating RRDs. The format [.guihint]#One RRD per host/service# ({CMK} format,
or CMK format for short) stores all of a host’s or service’s metrics  into a
single RRD-file. This enables more efficient writing of data on a drive, so that a
complete set of metrics can always be written in a single operation. These
metrics are then located in neighbouring storage blocks, thereby reducing the
number of blocks that must be written to the disk.

Please note that the [.guihint]#One RRD per host/service# format is not supported by
PNP4Nagios.

If your {CMK} instances were created with any of the {CEE} older than version
{v128}, you might want to have a closer look at whether your measurement
data was ever converted to the current and way more efficient format. Should the
data still be stored in PNP format you can convert it into the {CMK} format by
applying a rule as shown in the rule set above. Here you will also require the
`cmk --convert-rrds` command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -v --convert-rrds
myhost123:
    Uptime PNP -> CMC..converted.
   WARNING: Dupliate RRDs for stable/Uptime. Use --delete-rrds for cleanup.
    OMD heute apache PNP -> CMC..converted.
   WARNING: Dupliate RRDs for stable/OMD heute apache. Use --delete-rrds for cleanup.
    fs_/home/mk PNP -> CMC..converted.
   WARNING: Dupliate RRDs for stable/fs_/home/mk. Use --delete-rrds for cleanup.
    OMD slave apache PNP -> CMC..converted.
   WARNING: Dupliate RRDs for stable/OMD slave apache. Use --delete-rrds for cleanup.
    Memory PNP -> CMC..converted.
...
----

You can see by the warning that {CMK} at first leaves the existing files
unaltered. This enables you, if in doubt, to return to this original data format, since
a conversion in the reverse direction is *not* possible. The
`--delete-rrds` option ensures that this copy is not created, or is
later deleted. You can easily perform the deletion later manually by again using the
command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -v --convert-rrds --delete-rrds
----


[#rrdcached]
=== The RRD cache daemon (rrdcached)

In order to (drastically) reduce the number of write accesses to a disk drive,
an auxilliary service can be used: the RRD cache daemon (rrdcached). This is
one of the services started when an instance is started:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd start
Starting mkeventd (builtin: syslog-udp)...OK
Starting Livestatus Proxy-Daemon...OK
Starting mknotifyd...OK
*Starting rrdcached...OK*
Starting Check_MK Micro Core...OK
Starting dedicated Apache for site stable...OK
Initializing Crontab...OK
----

All new performance data for the RRDs are sent from the ({EE}) core or from
the NPCD ({RE}) to the rrdcached. This does not write the data directly into
the RRDs, but rather holds it in main memory for later writing as a collection
to the respective RRD. In this way the number of write accesses to the disk
drive (or to the SAN!) are noticibly reduced.

So that no data is lost in the case of a restart the updates are additionally
written to journal log files. These are also write accesses, but as the data is
arranged sequentially, they generate little IO.

For the RRD cache daemon to be able to work efficiently, it needs a lot of main
memory. The amount required depends on the number of RRDs and on how long the
data should be cached. The latter can be defined in the
`etc/rrdcached.conf` data. The standard setting is to store for 7200
seconds (two hours) -- this value can be customised by the user -- plus a random
range of 0-1800 seconds (this maximum value is fixed). This randomised delay
per RRD averts ‘pulsed’ writing and ensures that IO is distributed regularly
over time:

[{file}]
----
# Data is written to disk every TIMEOUT seconds. If this option is
# not specified the default interval of 300 seconds will be used.
*TIMEOUT=3600*

# rrdcached will delay writing of each RRD for a random
# number of seconds in the range [0,delay).This will avoid too many
# writes being queued simultaneously. This value should be no
# greater than the value specified in TIMEOUT.
*RANDOM_DELAY=1800*

# Every FLUSH_TIMEOUT seconds the entire cache is searched for old values
# which are written to disk. This only concerns files to which
# updates have stopped, so setting this to a high value, such as
# 3600 seconds, is acceptable in most cases.
*FLUSH_TIMEOUT=7200*
