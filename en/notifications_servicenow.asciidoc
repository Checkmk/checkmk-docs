== Function

{cee-only}
The connection of link:https://www.servicenow.com/[ServiceNow^] is only available for the {EE}.
The ServiceNow platform allows the mapping and automation of various workflows (keyword ITIL), including the forwarding of {CMK} notifications to users.

The integration runs using the instance URL and login data.


== Configuring ServiceNow

A special configuration within ServiceNow is not required, only the instance URL (possibly in the form of a custom URL) and user data must be known.


== Configuration in {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article about xref:notifications.html[notifications].
To connect ServiceNow, now proceed as follows in {CMK}:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Servicenow (Enterprise only)#.
. For the [.guihint]#ServiceNow URL# enter your instance URL.
. Add the user name and password of the _creating_ user.
. Under [.guihint]#Caller ID# add the user name of the _concerned_ user. It is recommended to use the same user name as creating and concerned user. See the {CMK} inline help for more detailed information.

All other options are only used to design the notification content. 
For the two ServiceNow-specific options [.guihint]#Urgency# and [.guihint]#Impact# you can find in the inline help of {CMK} links to the respective entries of the ServiceNow documentation.

For testing you can use the [.guihint]#Fake check results# and [.guihint]#Custom notification# xref:commands#[commands].
