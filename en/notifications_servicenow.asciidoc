== Function

{cee-only}
The connection of link:https://www.servicenow.com/[ServiceNow^] is only available for the commercial editions.
The ServiceNow platform allows the mapping and automation of various workflows (keyword ITIL), including the forwarding of {CMK} notifications to users.
The integration runs using the site's URL and login data.


== Configuring ServiceNow

A special configuration within ServiceNow is not required, only the site URL (possibly in the form of a custom URL) and user data must be known.
The user must have the role _itil_ in ServiceNow.


== Configuration in {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

As a reminder:

include::include_ticketsystem.asciidoc[]

To connect ServiceNow, now proceed as follows in {CMK}:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Servicenow (Enterprise only)#.
. For the [.guihint]#ServiceNow URL# enter your site URL.
. Add the user name and password of the _creating_ user.
. Select the [.guihint]#Management type#: ServiceNow has two types, _case_ and _incident_. Depending on your selection, the options displayed below will change.
Each of the options offered in {CMK}, both for the _case_ type and the _incident_ type corresponds to the setting of the same name in ServiceNow.

=== Setting up the _Case_ management type

If you have selected [.guihint]#Case#, you can set various other options to shape the content of the notification.

=== Setting up the _Incident_ management type

If you have selected [.guihint]#Incident#, there are a couple of notable specifics on how a notification is laid out.

. Under [.guihint]#Caller ID# add the user name of the _concerned_ user. It is recommended to use the _same_ user name for _both_ the creating _and_ the receiving user. See the {CMK} inline help for more detailed information.
. Again, all other options are used to define the content of the notification.
. For the two ServiceNow-specific options [.guihint]#Urgency# and [.guihint]#Impact#, in the {CMK} inline help you can find links to the respective entries in the ServiceNow documentation.

=== Testing the notifications

For testing you can use the [.guihint]#Fake check results# and [.guihint]#Custom notification# xref:commands#[commands].
