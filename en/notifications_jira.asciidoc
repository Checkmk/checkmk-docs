:title: Notifications via Jira
:description: You can have {CMK} send notifications to Jira to create and close Jira issues. Find out here how to connect.

{related-start}
xref:notifications#[Notifications]
{related-end}


{cee-only}
If you use the Jira software for project management, software development or for tracking bugs, with the commercial editions you can send notifications from {CMK} to Jira and create _Issues_ there.
This works for the Jira applications _Jira Core_, _Jira Software_ and _Jira Service Desk_.

The following options are supported:

* Create issues for host and service problems.
* Create issues with a defined _Priority_.
* Create issues with a defined _Label_.
* Set links to host/services in {CMK} from the generated Jira issues.
* Set a _Resolution_ in the issue when {OK} conditions occur.

To set up the link from {CMK} to Jira, first create some new _Fields_ in Jira and identify specific Jira _IDs._
Then configure the notification method for Jira in {CMK}.


[#config_jira]
== Configuring Jira

When interacting with Jira, {CMK} needs to know which notifications have already created an issue and which have not.
To make this possible, you need to create two so-called [.guihint]#Custom fields# in Jira -- one for notifications on host issues, and one for service issues.

In order to be able to correctly identify host and service issues, the IDs of these issues must be unique.
This is the case if your Jira instance receives notifications from only a _single_ {CMK} site, as the monitoring core of a {CMK} site ensures uniqueness.
Now, in distributed monitoring, multiple {CMK} sites may send notifications if xref:distributed_monitoring#notifications[decentralized notifications] has been configured.
If your Jira instance receives notifications from multiple {CMK} sites, any uniqueness is most likely over -- at the very latest when the ID from a host issue has already been used by another {CMK} site.
In such a configuration you need another user-defined field for the {CMK} site with which a unique assignment again becomes possible.

For the configuration in {CMK} you need the Jira IDs of the user-defined fields you created -- and additionally those of some other fields, so all together the following are required:

* Project ID
* Issue type ID
* Priority ID (optional)
* Host custom field ID
* Service custom field ID
* Site custom field ID (optional)
* (Workflow) Transition ID (optional)

The vast majority of these IDs can be read using the script below via one of Jira's REST APIs. Jira administrators can also retrieve the IDs via Jira's GUI -- even those IDs that cannot be retrieved via the API and thus the script.


[#jira_custom_fields]
=== Setting up the user-defined fields in Jira

[#jira_host_field]
==== Creating a field for host problems

. As the Jira administrator, open the [.guihint]#Administration# item in the header bar: 
+
[{image-border}]
image::jira_admin_settings.png[width=300]

. Now select [.guihint]#Issues# and navigate in the [.guihint]#Fields# section to [.guihint]#Custom Fields.# Via [.guihint]#Add custom field# -- this button may be hidden in the upper third of the right screen border depending on the Jira product -- you can create a new custom field.

. In the next window, select [.guihint]#All# so that all field types are displayed.
+
[{image-border}]
image::notifications_jira_custom_field.png[]

. Click the field type [.guihint]#Number Field# and then [.guihint]#Next#:
+
[{image-border}]
image::jira_custom_field_2.png[]

. For example, enter `CMK_HOST_FIELD` as the [.guihint]#Name#. You can also optionally enter a description of the new field in the [.guihint]#Description#. Confirm the whole thing by clicking on [.guihint]#Create#.


[#jira_service_field]
==== Creating a field for service problems

Since you also need such a field for service problem notifications, repeat the procedure as described xref:jira_host_field[above], but this time with a corresponding entry for services, for instance with the field name `CMK_SVC_FIELD`.


[#jira_site_field]
==== Creating a field for the {CMK} site

For the optional site field, in principle you can also follow the xref:jira_host_field[instructions as above].
This time, however, choose [.guihint]#Text Field (single line)# as the field type and `CMK_SITE_FIELD` as the field name, for example.

[#jira_ids_script]
=== Determining Jira IDs using an external script

You can query the IDs collectively with the following script, which uses the link:https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/latest[Jira REST API^].

Replace `JIRA_USERNAME`, `JIRA_PASSWORD`, `PROJECT_KEY` and `\https://jira.server.your-domain.de` with your applicable values.
You can also determine the `PROJECT_KEY` from the Jira GUI without requiring administrator rights.

urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

user = "JIRA_USERNAME"

def handle_response(user, password, jira_instance, what):
    url = "%s/rest/api/2/%s" % (jira_instance, what)
    sess = requests.Session()
    sess.auth = (user, password)
    response = sess.get(url, verify=False)

    return response

sys.stdout.write("=== IDs for project %s ===\n" % project_key)
infotext = ""
for section, id_name in [ ("Project_ID", "project"),
                          ("Issue", "issuetype"),
                          ("Priority", "priority"),
                          ("Field", "field"),
                        ]:

    json_response = handle_response(user,password,jira_instance,id_name).json()
    if id_name == "project":
        infotext = ""
        for project in json_response:
            if project["key"] == project_key:
                infotext += "%s\n\n" % project.get("id", "Project ID not found")
        if not infotext:
            infotext += "Project ID not found, project name existing?\n\n"
    else:
        types = ""
        for line in json_response:
            if id_name == "field":
                if line["name"].lower() == custom_field_1.lower() or \
                    line["name"].lower() == custom_field_2.lower() or \
                    line["name"].lower() == custom_field_3.lower():
                    types += "%s: %s\n" % (line["name"], line["id"].split("_")[1])
            else:
                types += "%s: %s\n" % (line["name"], line["id"])

        infotext += "=== %s types\n%s\n" % (section, types)

sys.stdout.write(infotext)

The output from the script will look something like this:

[#jira_ids_gui]
=== Determining Jira IDs using the GUI

As an alternative to executing scripts, you can also read out the IDs via the Jira GUI, but for this you need to log in to Jira with an administrator account.
Atlassian, the manufacturer of Jira, has described this procedure using the example of the Project ID in its own link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-get-project-id-from-the-jira-user-interface-827341414.html[instructions^].

The IDs of the other fields and types of issues can be read by editing the respective element in the Jira Administrator GUI.
The ID is then usually the last value in your browser's address bar.


[#config_cmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

To use the Jira notifications, proceed as follows in {CMK}:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#JIRA (Commercial editions only#:
+
image::jira_notification_rule.png[alt="The notification method settings for Jira."]
+
. In the [.guihint]#JIRA URL# field, enter the URL of your Jira instance, e.g. `jira.server.your-domain.com`.

. In [.guihint]#User Name# and [.guihint]#Password# you store the Jira account's data for this access.

. For [.guihint]#Project ID# and [.guihint]#Issue type ID# you need the previously-identified IDs in Jira, in the example '10401' for the Project ID and '10006' for the Issue type 'Bug'.

. For [.guihint]#Host custom field ID#, [.guihint]#Service custom field ID# and (optionally) [.guihint]#Site custom field ID# enter the IDs of the custom fields you created in Jira.

. To be able to link directly to {CMK} from any generated issues, under [.guihint]#Monitoring URL# enter the URL for your {CMK} site, for example: `\https://mycmkserver/mysite`

Furthermore, you also have the following optional settings:

* With the [.guihint]#Priority ID# you can define with which priority the issues are created in Jira. Here you can enter one of the 'priority types' read out in the script, from '1' to '5'.

* You can change the descriptions that are created for host and service problems in the issues via the options [.guihint]#Summary for host notifications# and [.guihint]#Summary for service notifications#.

* You can use the [.guihint]#Label# option to define whether you want to pass labels when creating issues in Jira. If you activate Label without entering a value, `monitoring` will be set. +
{CMK} writes the value of the label into the Jira `labels` field, that only works if this field exists in your Jira application, which is the case with _Jira Software_, but not with _Jira Service Desk_ for example.

* If you also want to have a [.guihint]#Resolution# entered into the issue in Jira when notifying of a state change to {OK} in {CMK}, you can define it under [.guihint]#Activate resolution with following resolution transition ID#. +
To be able to determine the correct ID here, you also need administrator rights in Jira. Navigate back to the [.guihint]#Issues# area and click on [.guihint]#Workflows#. Then click on [.guihint]#View# in the row of the standard workflow of the Jira project you are using. If you now see a flowchart, change the display by clicking on [.guihint]#Text#. You will be able to read the desired ID in the [.guihint]#Transitions (id)# column.

* With [.guihint]#Set optional timeout for connections to JIRA# you can configure the timeout for connections to Jira. If you do not enter anything here, the default value of 10 seconds will apply.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:

include::include_ticketsystem.asciidoc[]

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notifications#notification_testing[notifications].


[#diagnosis]
== Diagnostic options

If no tickets arrive in Jira after setting up the notification rule in {CMK}, check the associated log file `~/var/log/notify.log`. 
Jira usually returns quite useful error messages here, which can actually help you with the problem diagnosis. 
In the following we list some examples.


[discrete]
=== Error message: Unable to create issue, JIRA response code 400, Field 'labels' cannot be set.

Your Jira product may not have labels. 
Simply disable the use of labels in your notification rule in {CMK} by unchecking [.guihint]#Label#.


[discrete]
=== Error message: Unable to create issue, JIRA response code 400, b'project is required'.

This error message indicates that the ID you entered in the notification rule for the field in question (here: Project ID) is incorrect.


[discrete]
=== Error message: Unable to resolve \https://jira.server.your-domain.de/browse/ISSUE-123, JIRA response code 500, b'Internal server error'.

If you get this error message when a ticket in Jira is supposed to be closed automatically by {CMK}, or respectively should be changed to another status, then this *may* be a hint that the Transition ID you entered is not correct.
The Transition ID is in the notification rule in the [.guihint]#Activate resolution with following resolution transition ID# field.
As a rule, you should compare this ID again with the Jira web interface.
