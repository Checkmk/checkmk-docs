== Download the appropriate packages

If you have a subscription, on your link:https://checkmk.com/download.php[subscription downloads page]
you will find a suitable RPM or DEB package for your distribution
for every available xref:cmk_versions#[{CMK}-Version].  For a free test or
small installations of {CMK} you can use our link:https://checkmk.com/download.php[free Editions].
These don't need in consequence any subscription. You are still
able to do an xref:update#updatedemo[upgrade] any time to go to on of the {CEE}
on a later on.

Please consider when selecting a package:

* Firstly, choose a version of {CMK}, a distribution and the version of this distribution.
* We recommend the _latest stable version_. If you need an older version anyway, you can find these in link:https://checkmk.com/download-archive.php[download archive] at the of the page.
* The name and version of your distribution must be strictly identical.
* Choose one of the Editions. If you're unsure, you can get an overview to the differences of the link:https://checkmk.com/editions.html[editions].

After you downloaded the package to your machine, you need to copy the
file to the target Linux system where {CMK} needs to be installed. You can
do that for example with the program _WinSCP_ or -- if you are able
to use ssh connections -- with the command line tool `scp`.

To be able to copy files to your future {CMK}-server using `scp` the
package openssh-server needs to be installed. If that is not the case already,
you can set it up using the following command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt install openssh-server
----

Once this is done you can copy for example the package of the {CRE} for _Ubuntu 20.04 (focal fossa)_ using the command below:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} scp check-mk-raw-2.0.0p3_0.focal_amd64.deb root@mymonitoring.mydomain.org:
----

[#signed]
== Signed-package installation

All packages are signed using link:https://gnupg.org[GnuPG]. Through the
use of this signature, on the one hand it can be verified whether the package
really is from {CMK}, and on the other hand it can be verified that the package
is complete.

Depending on which optional packages were installed during the setup of your
distribution, you will have to install dpkg-sig including all its dependencies.
To do so, just enter the following command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt install dpkg-sig
----

So that these signed packages can be installed in the usual way, one time only
you will need to import our public key so that the signature will be trusted.
First, load the key directly from our website:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} wget \https://download.checkmk.com/checkmk/Check_MK-pubkey.gpg
----

*Alternatively*, the key can also be obtained from link:https://keys.openpgp.org[keys.openpgp.org]:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 434DAC48C4503261
{c-root} gpg --armor --export 434DAC48C4503261 > Check_MK-pubkey.gpg
----

Then import the key from the list of trusted signatures. Under Debian and Ubuntu the
following command is required:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} gpg --import Check_MK-pubkey.gpg
----

Once the key has been added, you can verify the {CMK}-package using the
following command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} dpkg-sig --verify check-mk-raw-2.0.0p3_0.focal_amd64.deb
----

Afterwards you can install the {CMK}-package using following command. Please note that you should state the full path to the .deb file after `apt install`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt install /tmp/check-mk-raw-2.0.0p3_0.focal_amd64.deb
----


== Final test

After the successful installation of {CMK}, and all dependencies, you will
have access to the `omd` command. With this command you are able
to create and manage xref:omd_basics#[monitoring sites]. You can request the
installed version to verify your installation:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd version
OMD - Open Monitoring Distribution Version 2.0.0p3.cre
----
