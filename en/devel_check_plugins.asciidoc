== Introduction

{CMK} includes nearly 2000 ready-made check plug-ins for all imaginable hardware and software.
These are maintained by the {CMK} team, and new plug-ins are added every week.
On the link:https://exchange.checkmk.com[{CMK} Exchange]
there are also more plug-ins contributed by our users.

And yet there are always situations where a device, an application,
or just a specific metric that is important to you is not covered by any of
these plug-ins -- maybe because it is something that was developed within your
own company and is therefore not available to anyone else.


=== Does it always have to be a real plug-in?

What options do you have for implementing an effective monitoring here?
Well, you could of course contact our
link:https://checkmk.com/product/pricing#/[support team]
and request that they develop a suitable plug-in for you -- but naturally it is
quicker if you can do it yourself.

You have four options:

[cols=4]
|===
|Method |How to do it |Advantages |Disadvantages 

|link:localchecks.html[Localcheck] |Extend a {CMK} Agent with a simple script |Is very simple, is possible in all programming languages offered by the monitored host’s operating system, and even supports service discovery |Threshold configuration only for the agent itself, SNMP not possible or very cumbersome

This article will show you how to develop real {CMK} check plug-ins -- along
with everything associated with them.
Here we show you how to use the *newly-developed API* for programming
plug-ins in version {v20} of {CMK}.


=== What has changed compared to the old API?

Do you already have experience with developing check plug-ins for {CMK} Version
{v16} or earlier? If so, here is a concise overview of all of the
changes introduced in the new Check API available from Version {v20}:

* Plug-ins are now Python 3 modules, and the file names must have the `.py` extension.
* The custom plug-ins are now located in the `local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based` directory.
* At the beginning of the file you will now need at least one special `import` statement.
* The sections and the actual checks are now stored separately. For this purpose there are the new `register.agent_section` and `register.check_plugin` functions.
* Several function and argument names have been renamed. Among other things, _Discovery_ is now always used consistently (previously _Inventory_).
* The Discovery function (formerly Inventory function) and also the Check function must now _always_ work as generators (so use `yield`).
* The names for the declared functions' arguments are now fixed.
* Instead of the SNMP scan function, write a _declaration_ of which OIDs are expected with which values.
* The functions for representing numbers have been restructured (e.g. `get_bytes_human_readable` becomes `render.bytes`).
* There is now a separate method for checks to exclude others (`supersedes`). This is no longer done in the SNMP scan function.
* The auxiliary functions for working with counters, rates and averages have changed.
* Instead of magic return values such as `2` for {CRIT}, there are now constants (e.g. `State.CRIT`).
* Many possible programming errors in your plug-in are now recognised by {CMK} at a very early stage and can be immediately highlighted for you.


=== Will the old API still be supported?

Yes -- the API for the development of check plug-ins valid up to version
{v16} of {CMK} will be supported with some minor restrictions for a few
more years, because a significant number of plug-ins have been developed
with it. During this time, {CMK} will offer both APIs in parallel.
Details can be found in the
link:https://checkmk.com/werk/10601[#10601] work.

Nevertheless, we do recommend the new API for the development of new plug-ins,
as it is more consistent and logical, better documented and is the most
future-proof solution in the long term.


=== The different types of agents

Check plug-ins evaluate the data from the {CMK} agents. And that is why, before
we leap into action here, we should first look at an overview of the types of
agents that {CMK} actually recognises:



[cols="20,~"]
|===

|{CMK} Agent |The ‘normal’ plug-ins evaluate data that the {CMK} agent sends for Linux, Windows or other operating systems. This agent monitors operating system parameters and applications, and sometimes also server hardware. Each new check plug-in requires an extension of the agent to provide the necessary data. Therefore you first develop an agent plug-in, and then one or more check plug-ins that evaluate this data.
|Special Agent / API-Integration |You need a special agent if you do not receive the data that is relevant for monitoring from either the normal {CMK} agent or link:snmp.html[SNMP]. The most common application for Special Agent is querying HTTP-based APIs. Examples are, e.g. Monitoring link:monitoring_aws.html[AWS], link:monitoring_azure.html[Azure], or link:monitoring_vmware.html[VMware]. In this case you write a script that runs directly on the {CMK} server, connects to the API, and outputs data in the same format as an agent plug-in would. For this you write suitable check plug-ins in the same way as with the ‘agent-based’ monitoring.
|SNMP |When monitoring via link:snmp.html[SNMP] you do not need an extension of an agent, but simply evaluate the data retrieved from your device via SNMP, which provides this by default. {CMK} supports you and takes over all of the details and special features of the SNMP protocol. There is in fact an agent here as well -- namely the SNMP agent which is pre-installed on the system being monitored.
|Active Check |This check type forms a special role. Here you first write a classic Nagios-compatible plug-in which is intended for execution _on the {CMK} server_, and which from there uses a network protocol to directly query a service on the target device. The most prominent example is the `check_http` plug-in which allows you to monitor web servers and web pages. You can then integrate this plug-in into {CMK} so that it can be set up as usual via rules.

=== Prerequisites

If you feel like programming check plug-ins, you need to satisfy the following prerequisites:

* Knowledge of the Python programming language
* Experience with {CMK}, especially with regard to agents and checks
* Experience with Linux on the command line

[#agentbased]
== A first simple check plug-in

After this long introduction, it's time we programmed our first simple check
plug-in. As an example, let's take a simple monitoring for Linux.
Since ( CMK ) itself runs on Linux, it is very likely that you also have access
to a Linux system.

The check plug-in will create a new service that detects whether someone has
inserted a USB stick on a Linux server. In this case, this service should then
become critical. You might even find something like this useful, but it is really
only a simplified example and possibly also not programmed in a completely
watertight way -- but for now that's not what this exercise is really about.

The whole procedure involves two steps:

. We find out which Linux command can be used to determine whether a USB stick has been plugged in, and then extend the Linux agent with a small script that calls this command.
. We then write a check plug-in in the {CMK} instance that evaluates this data.

Here we go...


=== Find the right command

At the beginning of any check programming activity is the necessary research!
This means that we have to find out how we can get the information we need for
monitoring. With Linux, this will often involve command line commands.
In Windows, PowerShell, VBScript or WMI can help, and with link:snmp.html[SNMP] we have
to find the right OIDs (there is an link:devel_check_plugins.html#snmp[own chapter] for this).

Unfortunately, there is no general procedure for determining the correct command,
so we do not want to spend too much time on the subject here, we will however briefly explain
how it works for a USB stick.

First we log in to the host we want to monitor. Under Linux, the agent runs
as the `root` user by default -- which is why we perform all our tests as `root`. For our task with the USB stick, there are convenient
symbolic links in the directory `/dev/disk/by-id`. These point to all the
Linux block devices. And a plugged-in USB stick is one such device. In addition,
you can tell by the ID of the prefix `usb-` when a block device is a USB
device.

The following command lists all entries in this directory:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 May 14 11:21 ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191 -> ../../sda

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 May 14 11:21 wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part5 -> ../../sda5
----

So -- and now the whole thing with the plugged in USB stick:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Mai 14 11:21 ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191 -> ../../sda

----


=== Purging the data

Actually, we would be finished with that and could transport this whole output
via the {CMK} agent to the {CMK} server and have it analysed there as well,
because in {CMK} the following recommendation always applies: always let the
server do the complex work, so keep the agent plug-in as simple as possible.

But there is still too much hot air in here. It is always good not to transfer
unnecessary data. This saves network traffic, memory, computing time and also
makes everything clearer. That is a better way of doing things!

First, we can omit the `-l`.
This already makes the output of `ls` much leaner:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} ls /dev/disk/by-id/
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191        ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part5  wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part3
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part1  wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part4                ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part2
wwn-0x5002538655584d30                      wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part5                ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part3
wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part1                ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part4  wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part2
----

Now again, the multi-column structure is disturbing, but this is only because
the `ls` command recognises that it is running in an interactive terminal.
Later, as part of the agent, it will output the data in a single column.
But we can also easily force this here with the `-1` option (for output in *one* column):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} ls -1 /dev/disk/by-id/
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part1
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part2
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part3
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part4
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191-part5
wwn-0x5002538655584d30
wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part1
wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part2
wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part3
wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part4
wwn-0x5002538655584d30-part5
----

If you look closely, you will see not only the block devices themselves,
but also any partitions that exist there. These are the entries that end in
`-part1`, `-part2`, etc. We do not need these for our check and
can get rid of them quite easily with a `grep`. There we take the `-v` option for negative logic:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} ls /dev/disk/by-id/ | grep -v -- -part
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191
usb-SCSI_DISK-0:0
wwn-0x5002538655584d30
----

Here you can now see much more clearly that in our
example there are in fact exactly three devices when the USB stick is plugged in.

Perfect! We now have a clear list of all block devices which has been
compiled with a simple command. That's all we need.

We have again omitted the `-1` in the last command, because `ls` now writes into a pipe and outputs a single column by itself. And `grep` needs the
`--` because otherwise it would interpret the word `-part` as the
four options `-p`, `-a`, `-r` and `-t`.

And by the way: Why don't we simply "grep" for `usb` in addition so that only USB devices are output? Well, of course we could do that. But for one thing,
our example then becomes increasingly boring, and besides, it is somehow more
reassuring to get _some_ content in the section in a normal situation and not
simply nothing. In this way one can see immediately on the {CMK} server that the
agent plug-in is working correctly.


=== Include the command in the agent

In order for us to be able to retrieve this data from the {CMK} server,
we need to make the new command part of the {CMK} agent on the system being
monitored. We could of course simply edit the `/usr/bin/check_mk_agent` file
there and include that. However, this would have the disadvantage that our
command would disappear again when we update the agent's software because the
file will be replaced at that point.

It is therefore better if we make an *agent plug-in*. This is even simpler.
All we need is an executable file with our command in the
`/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins` directory.

And one more point is important: we can't just output our data like this.
What we still need is a *section header*. This is a specially-formatted
line that contains our new check's name. By means of these section headers,
{CMK} can later recognise where this plug-in's data begins and the previous
plug-in's data ends.

So now we need a meaningful name for our new check. This name must consist of
lower case letters, underscores and numbers and be unique. There may not be an
existing check plug-in with this name. If you are curious about which names
already exist, in a {CMK} instance you can list them on the command line with
`cmk -L`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -L | head -n 20
3par_capacity                agent      HPE 3PAR: Capacity
3par_cpgs                    agent      HPE 3PAR: CPGs
3par_cpgs_usage              agent      HPE 3PAR: CPGs Usage
3par_hosts                   agent      HPE 3PAR: Hosts

acme_temp                    snmp       ACME Devices: Temperature
----

The second column shows how the respective check plug-in obtains its data.

For our example, let's choose the name `linux_usbstick`.
In this example the section header must look like this:

[{file}]
----
<<<linux_usbstick>>>
----

We can simply output this with `echo`. If we then don't forget the
'shabang' (this is not a venomous sting from the desert planet but an
abbreviation for _sharp_ and _bang_ -- the latter being an abbreviation
for the exclamation mark!), by which Linux recognises that it should execute the
script with the shell, in which case our plug-in will look like this:

./usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/linux_usbstick
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/sh
echo '<<<linux_usbstick>>>'
ls /dev/disk/by-id/ | grep -v -- -part
----

We have now simply used the file name `linux_usbstick`, even though it
doesn't really matter.
But one thing is still very important: Make the file executable!

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod +x /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/linux_usbstick
----

Of course, you can easily try out the plug-in by manually by entering the
complete path as a command:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/linux_usbstick
<<<linux_usbstick>>>
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191
wwn-0x5002538655584d30
----


=== Test the agent

As always, the next most important tasks are testing and troubleshooting.
It is best to proceed in three steps:

. Try out the plug-in on its own. We have just done that.
. From the agent test the whole process locally.
. Retrieve the agent via the {CMK} server.

Testing the agent locally is very simple -- as `root` user call
the command `check_mk_agent`.
The new section should appear somewhere in the output from this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent
----

Here is an excerpt from that output which contains the new section:

[{shell-raw}]
----
<<<lnx_thermal:sep(124)>>>
thermal_zone0|-|BAT0|35600
thermal_zone1|-|x86_pkg_temp|81000|0|passive|0|passive
<<<local>>>
<<<linux_usbstick>>>
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191
wwn-0x5002538655584d30
<<<lnx_packages:sep(124):persist(1589463274)>>>
accountsservice|0.6.45-1ubuntu1|amd64|deb|-||install ok installed
acl|2.2.52-3build1|amd64|deb|-||install ok installed
acpi|1.7-1.1|amd64|deb|-||install ok installed
----

By appending `less` you can scroll through the output (press the space
bar to scroll, `/` to search and `Q` to exit):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent | less
----

The third test is then performed directly from the {CMK} instance. Include the
host in the monitoring (e.g. as `myserver01`) and then retrieve the agent
data with `cmk -d`. You should get the same output here:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -d myserver01 | less
----

By the way: `grep` has the `-A` option to output a few more lines
after each hit.  This allows you to conveniently search and output the section:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} cmk -d myserver01 | grep -A5 '^<<< linux_usbstick'
<<<linux_usbstick>>>
ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191
wwn-0x5002538655584d30
<<<lnx_packages:sep(124):persist(1589463559)>>>
accountsservice|0.6.45-1ubuntu1|amd64|deb|-||install ok installed
----

If this works, your agent is now ready! And what have we done to achieve this?
We simply created a three-line script with the path
`/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/linux_usbstick` and made it executable!

Everything that follows now only takes place on the {CMK} server:
There we will write the actual check plug-in.


=== Declare the section

Preparing the agent is the most complicated part, but it is only half the battle.
Now we have to teach {CMK} how to handle the information and the new agent
section, which services it should generate, when they should go to {OK} or
{CRIT}, etc. We do all this by programming a check plug-in in Python.

For your own check plug-ins you will find a directory prepared in the
`local` hierarchy of the link:cmk_commandline.html#sitedir[instance directory].
This is `local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/`.
Here in the path, `base` means the part of {CMK} that is responsible for
actually monitoring and alerting. The `agent_based` is for all plug-ins
that relate to the {CMK} agent (so not alerting plug-ins, for example).
The easiest way to work with this is to switch to it:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cd local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based
----

This directory belongs to the instance user and is therefore editable by you.
You can edit your plug-in with any text editor installed on the Linux system.

So let's create our plug-in here. The convention is that the file name reflects
the agent section's name. _Mandatory_ is that the file ends with
`.py`, since from {CMK} version {v20} onwards the plug-ins
will always be real Python modules.

First, we need to import the functions needed for the plug-ins from other
Python modules. The simplest method for this is with a `pass:[*]`. As you might
guess, there is also a version number of the API for plug-in programming here.
This will be version 1 until further notice,
and is abbreviated here to `v1`:

.local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/linux_usbstick.py
[{file}]
----
from .agent_based_api.v1 import *
----

This versioning allows us to eventually provide future new versions of the API
_parallel_ to the previous ones, so that existing check plug-ins continue
to work without problems.

In the simplest case, you skip explicitly declaring the section.
If you want to implement a parse function (which professional developers would always advise you to do), see the link:devel_check_plugins.html#parsefunction[section on parse functions] for more information.


=== Registering the check

In order for {CMK} to know that the new check exists, it must be registered.
This is done by calling the function `register.check_plugin`.
In doing so, you must always specify at least four things:

. `name`: The name of the check plug-in. If you don't want to get into trouble, take the same name here as for your new agent section. This way the check will automatically know which section to evaluate.
. `service_name`: The name of the service as it should then appear in the monitoring.
. `discovery_function`: The function that discovers services of this type (more on this in a moment).
. `check_function`: The function to perform the actual check (more on this in a moment).

So for our check the registration will look like this:

[{file}]
----
register.check_plugin(
    name="linux_usbstick",
    service_name="USB stick",
    discovery_function=discover_linux_usbstick,
    check_function=check_linux_usbstick,
)
----

It's best not to try this out just yet, because of course we still have to write
the `discovery_linux_usbstick` and `check_linux_usbstick` functions
beforehand, and these functions must appear in the source code _before_
the above declaration.


=== Writing the Discovery Function

A special feature of {CMK} is the automatic discovery of services to be monitored.
In order for this to work, each check plug-in must define a function that detects
_whether_ a service of this type or _which_ services of this type are
to be created for the host in question on the basis of the agents' output.

The discovery function is always called when the service discovery is carried
out for a host. This function then decides whether or which services are to be
created. In the standard procedure, it receives exactly one argument with the
name `section`. This contains the data of the agent section in a parsed
format (more on this later).

We implement the following simple logic: _If_ the agent section
`linux_usbstick` exists, then we also create a matching service.
This service will then automatically appear on all hosts where our agent plug-in
has been rolled out. We recognise the presence of the section simply by the fact
that our discovery has actually been invoked!

The discovery function must return an object of the type `Service` for
each service to be created using `yield` (not with `return`).
For checks that can only occur once per host, no further information is needed:

[{file}]
----
def discovery_linux_usbstick(section):
    yield Service()
----


=== Writing the check function

So now we can come to the actual check function, which finally decides on the
basis of current agent outputs which state a service should assume. Since our
check has no parameters and there is only ever one per host, our function is
also called with the single argument `section`.

Since we really need the content this time, we have to deal with the format of
this argument. Unless you have explicitly defined a
link:devel_check_plugins.html#parsefunction[parse function]
{CMK} will parse each line
of the section into a _list of words_ using spaces. The whole thing then in
turn becomes a list of these word lists. So the end result is that we will
always have a list of lists.

In the simple case in which our agent plug-in only finds two devices,
it will then look like this (here there is only one word per line):

[{file}]
----
[['ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191'], ['wwn-0x5002538655584d30']]
----

The check function now goes through line by line and looks for a line whose
first (and only) word begins with `usb-SCSI_DISK`.
If this is found, the state will become {CRIT}. Here is the implementation:

[{file}]
----
def check_linux_usbstick(section):
    for line in section:
        if line[0].startswith("usb-SCSI_DISK"):
            yield Result(state=State.CRIT, summary="Found USB stick")
            return
    yield Result(state=State.OK, summary="No USB stick found")
----

And here is the explanation:

. With `for line in section` we loop through all of the lines in the agent's output.
. We then check whether the first word in the line -- the respective device -- begins with `usb-SCSI_DISK`.
. If yes, we generate a check result with the status {CRIT} and the text `Found USB stick`. And we then end the function with a `return`.
. If the loop is run without finding anything, it will generate the status {OK} and the text `No USB stick found`.


=== Testing the discovery




=== Testing the check




=== The complete plug-in at a glance

And here is the complete plug-in one more time:

.local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/linux_usbstick.py
[{file}]
----
from .agent_based_api.v1 import *

def discover_linux_usbstick(section):
    yield Service()

def check_linux_usbstick(section):
    for line in section:
        if line[0].startswith("usb-SCSI_DISK"):
            yield Result(state=State.CRIT, summary="Found USB stick")
            return
    yield Result(state=State.OK, summary="No USB stick found")

register.check_plugin(
    name = "linux_usbstick",
    service_name = "USB stick",
    discovery_function = discover_linux_usbstick,
    check_function = check_linux_usbstick,
)
----

And this is the plug-in for the Linux agent:

./usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/linux_usbstick
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/sh
echo '<<<linux_usbstick>>>'
ls /dev/disk/by-id/ | grep -v -- -part
----


== Checks with more than one service (items) per host


=== Basic principles

In our example, we have built a very simple check that creates a service on a
host -- or not. A very common situation is, of course, that there can be several
services with one check on one host.

The most common example of this is the file systems for a host.
The plug-in named `df` creates one service per file system on the host.
To distinguish these services, the mount point of the file system
(e.g. `/var`), or the drive letter (e.g. `C:`) is built into the
service name.  This then results in the service name being,
e.g. `filesystem /var`, or `filesystem C:`.
The word `/var` or `C:` is referred to here as the _item_.
So we also speak of a check _with items_.

If you want to build a check with multiple items,
you need to implement the following things:

* The discovery function must generate a service for each of the items that are to be meaningfully monitored on the host.
* In the service name you must include this item using the `%s` wildcard (i.e. `"Filesystem %s"`).
* The check function is invoked once separately for each item and receives this as an argument. It must then fish out the relevant data for this item from the agent data.


=== A simple example

To be able to test the whole thing practically, we will simply build another
agent section that only outputs game data. A small shell script is sufficient
for this. The section should be called `foobar` in this example:

./usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/foobar
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/sh
echo "<<<foobar>>>"
echo "West 100 100"
echo "East 197 200"
echo "North 0 50"
----

From _foobar_, there are three sectors to be found here: `West`,
`East` and `North` (whatever that means).
In each sector there are a number of _seats_, some of which are occupied
(e.g. in `West` 100 of 100 seats are occupied).

Now we will create a matching check plug-in for this.
The registration is as usual, but with the important difference that the service
name now contains exactly one `%s`.
At this position the item's name will be inserted later by {CMK}:

[{python}]
----
register.check_plugin(
    name = "foobar",
    service_name = "Foobar Sector %s",
    discovery_function = discover_foobar,
    check_function = check_foobar,
)
----

The discovery function now has the task of determining the items to be monitored.
As usual, it receives the `section` argument. And again, this is a list
of lines, which in turn are lists of words.

In our example the list looks like this:

[{python}]
----
[['West', '100', '100'], ['East', '197', '200'], ['North', '0', '50']]
----

You can loop through such a list with Python and give meaningful names to these
three words grouped in each line:

[{python}]
----
for sector, _used, _slots in section:
    ...
----

In each line, the first word -- here the sector -- is our item.
Whenever we find an item, we return that with `yield`, creating an object
of type `Service` that gets the sector name as its item. The underscore
indicates that for now we don't care about the other two columns in the output,
since in a discovery it ultimately doesn't matter how many slots are occupied.

Overall it looks like this:

[{python}]
----
def discover_foobar(section):
    for sector, _used, _slots in section:
        yield Service(item=sector)
----

Of course, it would be easy to omit some lines here on the basis of arbitrary
criteria. Maybe there are sectors which have a size of 0 and which you would
never want to monitor? Simply omit such rows so that no item will be generated
for them.

Then later, when the host is being monitored, the check function is called
separately for each service -- and thus for each item. Therefore, in addition to
the section, it also receives the `item` argument with the item it is
looking for. Now we go through all of the lines one after the other.
When doing so, we will find the line that corresponds to the desired item:

[{python}]
----
def check_foobar(item, section):
    for sector, used, slots in section:
        if sector == item:
            ...
----

Now all that is missing is the actual logic which determines when the item
should in fact be {OK}, {WARN} or {CRIT}. We do that here like this:

* When all slots have been used, the thing is to become {CRIT}.
* If there are fewer than 10 slots free, then it will become {WARN}.
* Otherwise {OK}

The occupied and total slots always appear as the second and third words in each
line. However, here we are dealing with strings, not numbers -- but we need
numbers to be able to compare and calculate. We therefore convert the strings
into numbers using `int()`.

We then return the check result by supplying an object of type `result`
via `yield`. This takes the parameters `state` and `summary`:

[{python}]
----
def check_foobar(item, section):
    for sector, used, slots in section:
        if sector == item:
            used = int(used)   # convert string to int
            slots = int(slots)   # convert string to int
            if used == slots:
                s = State.CRIT
            elif slots - used <= 10:
                s = State.WARN
            else:
                s = State.OK
            yield Result(
                state = s,
                summary = f"Used {used} out of {slots} slots")
            return
----

In this context, please note the following:

. The command `return` ensures that the check function is terminated immediately after processing the found item. There is nothing more to be done, after all.
. If the loop is processed without finding the item being searched for, {CMK} _automatically_ generates the result `UNKNOWN - Item not found in monitoring data`. This is intentional and a good thing. Do not handle this case yourself. If you don't find an item you are looking for, just let Python run its course through the function and let {CMK} do its work.
. With the argument `summary` you define the text that the service produces from the status output. This is purely informal and will not be evaluated further by {CMK}.

By the way, for the common situation where you want to check a simple metric for
thresholds, there is a helper function called `check_levels`.
This is explained in a separate link:devel_check_plugins.html#check_levels[chapter].



Now let's first try out the Discovery. For the sake of clarity we will restrict
this action to our plug-in by using the `--detect-plugins=foobar` option:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --detect-plugins=foobar -vI myhost123
  [green]#3# foobar
SUCCESS - Found 3 services, 1 host labels
----

And now right away we can test the checking process
(here also limited to `foobar`):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --detect-plugins=foobar -v myhost123
Foobar Sector East   [yellow]#WARN - used 197 out of 200 slots#
Foobar Sector North  [green]#OK - used 0 out of 50 slots#
Foobar Sector West   [red]#CRIT - used 100 out of 100 slots#
----


=== The example -- a recap

And here again our example in full. To avoid errors due to undefined function
names, the functions must always be defined before registering.

.local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/foobar.py
[{python}]
----
from .agent_based_api.v1 import *
import pprint


def discover_foobar(section):
    for sector, used, slots in section:
        yield Service(item=sector)


def check_foobar(item, section):
    for sector, used, slots in section:
        if sector == item:
            used = int(used)    # convert string to int
            slots = int(slots)  # convert string to int
            if used == slots:
                s = State.CRIT
            elif slots - used <= 10:
                s = State.WARN
            else:
                s = State.OK
            yield Result(
                state = s,
                summary = f"used {used} out of {slots} slots")
            return


register.check_plugin(
    name = "foobar",
    service_name = "Foobar Sector %s",
    discovery_function = discover_foobar,
    check_function = check_foobar,
)
----


== Performance values

=== Determining values in the check function

Not always, but very often checks work with numbers.
With its link:graphing.html[graphing system] {CMK} has a component to store, evaluate and
display such numbers. This works completely independently from the generation of
any resulting {OK}, {WARN} or {CRIT} states.

Such measured values -- or metrics -- are determined by the check function and
simply returned as an additional result. For this purpose the `Metric`
object is used, which requires at least the two arguments `name` and
`value`. Here is an example:

[{file}]
----
    yield Metric("fooslots", used)
----


=== Threshold information

Furthermore there are two optional arguments. With the argument `levels`
you can provide information about thresholds for {WARN} and {CRIT},
in the form of a pair of two numbers. This is then usually plotted on the graph
as a yellow and a red line. The first number (yellow line) represents the warning
threshold, the second (red line) the critical one. The convention is that the
check already goes to {WARN} when the warning threshold is reached (analogous
for {CRIT}).

The coding could then look like this (here with hardcoded thresholds):

[{file}]
----
    yield Metric("fooslots", used, levels=(190,200))
----

Notes:

* If only one of the two thresholds will be defined, simply enter `None` for the other threshold, e.g. `levels=(None, 200)`.
* Floating point numbers are also allowed, but not strings.
* Attention: the check function itself is responsible for the _check_ of the thresholds .  The specification of `levels` serves only as marginal information for the graphing system!


=== The values range

Analogous to the threshold values, you can also provide the graphing system with
information about a range of possible values. This denotes the smallest and
largest possible value. This is done in the `boundaries` argument, where
`None` can also be optionally used here for one of the two boundaries.

Example:

[{file}]
----
    yield Metric(name="fooslots", value=used, boundaries=(0, 200))
----

And now once again our check function from the above example, but this time with
the return of metric information including threshold values and a value range
(this time of course not with fixed but with calculated values):

[{file}]
----
def check_foobar(item, section):
    for sector, used, slots in section:
        if sector == item:
            used = int(used)    # convert string to int
            slots = int(slots)  # convert string to int

            yield Metric(
                "fooslots",
                used,
                levels=(slots-10, slots),
                boundaries=(0, slots))

            if used == slots:
                s = State.CRIT
            elif slots - used <= 10:
                s = State.WARN
            else:
                s = State.OK
            yield Result(
                state = s,
                summary = f"used {used} out of {slots} slots")
            return
----







== Checks with multiple partial results

In order to prevent the number of services on a host from growing out of all
control, several partial results are often combined in a single service.
For example, the [.guihint]#Memory used# service under Linux checks not only RAM and swap
consumption, but also shared memory, page tables and various other information.

The API provided by {CMK} offers a very convenient interface for this. In this
way, a check function may simply generate a result with `yield` any
number of times. The overall status for the service is then based on the 'worst'
partial result according to the scheme {OK} → {WARN} → {UNKNOWN} → {CRIT}.

Here is an abbreviated, fictitious example:

[{file}]
----
def check_foobar(section):
    yield Result(state=State.OK, summary="Knulf rate optimal")
    # ...
    yield Result(state=State.WARN, summary="Gnarz required")
    # ...
    yield Result(state=State.OK, summary="Last Szork was good")
----

The summary of the service in the GUI then looks like this:
"Knulf rate optimal, Gnarz required {WARN}, Last Szork was good".
And the overall status will be {WARN}.

You can return multiple metrics in the same way.
Simply call `yield Metric(...)` once for each metric.


== Summary and Details

In the {CMK} monitoring, each service also has a line of text in addition
to its status {OK}, {WARN}, and so on. Up until version {v16} this was
called [.guihint]#Output of check plugin#. As of version {v20} this is now called
[.guihint]#Summary# -- so it has the task of providing a concise summary of the status.
The idea is that this text does not exceed a length of 60 characters,
so that it is always easy to read and ensures a clear table display without
annoying line breaks.

Next to this there is the [.guihint]#Details# field, which used to be called
[.guihint]#Long output of check plugin (multiline)#. Here all of the details of the state
are displayed, the idea being that all of the summary information is included
here as well.

When calling `yield Result(...)` you can determine which information is
so important that it should be displayed in the summary and for which information
it is sufficient that it appears in the details. The default rule is that partial
results that lead to a {WARN}/{CRIT} will _always_ be visible in the summary.

In our examples so far we have always used the following call:

[{file}]
----
    yield Result(state=State.OK, summary="some important text")
----

This will cause `some important text` to always appear in the
[.guihint]#Summary# -- and additionally in the [.guihint]#Details# -- so you should only use
this for important information. If a partial result is of secondary importance,
replace `summary` with `notice` and the text will appear -- if the service is {OK} _only_ in the details.

[{file}]
----
    yield Result(state=State.OK, notice="some additional text")
----

If the state is {WARN} or {CRIT}, the text will then automatically appear as an
addition in the summary:

[{file}]
----
    yield Result(state=State.CRIT, notice="some additional text")
----

Thus, in the summary it will be immediately clear why the service is not {OK}.

Last but not least, you have -- for both `summary` and `notice` --
the possibility to specify an _alternative_ text for the details,
which may contain more information about the partial result:

[{file}]
----
    yield Result(state=State.OK,
                 summary="55% used space",
                 details="55.2% of 160 GB used (82 GB)")
----

To summarize, this means:

* The full text of the summary (for services that are {OK}) should not exceed 60 characters.
* Always use either `summary` or `notice` -- not both, and not neither.
* Add `details` as necessary if you want the details text to be an alternative one.


[#errors]
== Error handling


=== Exceptions and Crash Reports

The correct handling of errors (unfortunately) consumes a large chunk of the
programming work. The good news is that the {CMK} API already does most of the
work for you. Consequently, in most cases, it is important for you to simply
*not* deal with errors.

When Python gets into a situation that is in some way _unexpected_ ,
it responds with what is known as an _exception_. Here are a few examples:

* You convert a string into a number with `int(...)`, but the string does not actually include a number, e.g. `int("foo")`.
* You access the fifth element of `bar` with `bar[4]`, but this in fact has only four elements.
* You are calling a function that does not exist.

Here the important general rule applies: <b>Don't capture exceptions
yourself!</b> {CMK} will always do this for you in a consistent and efficient
way -- in most cases accompanied by a _Crashreport_.
Such a report will look like this, for example:

image::crash_report_1.png[]

By clicking on the icon:icon_crash[] icon, the user is navigated to a page
where they can

* view a display of the file in which the crash took place.
* get all information about the crash, for instance any error messages, call stack, agent output, the current values of local variables and much more.
* send the report to us (tribe29) as feedback.

Submitting the report to tribe29 of course only makes sense for check plug-ins
which are official {CMK} components. But you can also ask your users to simply
send you the data. The users can then help you to find the error. It is often
the case that a check plug-in works for you, but other users may experience
sporadic errors.
Working together you can then usually identify these problems very easily.

But if you were to intercept the exception yourself, all of this information
would simply be unavailable. You would perhaps set the service to {UNKNOWN} and
issue an error message, but all of the background circumstances that led to an
error (e.g. the data from the agent) would simply be invisible.


=== Viewing exceptions on the command line

If you run your plug-in on the command line, no crash reports will be generated --
you will only see the summarized error message:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -II --detect-plugins=foobar myhost123
  WARNING: Exception in discovery function of check plugin 'foobar': invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'foo'
----

BUT: if you simply append the `--debug` option to this, you will then
receive the Python stack trace:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --debug -II --detect-plugins=foobar myhost123

=== Invalid outputs from an agent

The question is how to react when the output from the agent is not in the form
you would normally expect -- whether it is from the 'real' agent or when the data
comes via link:snmp.html[SNMP]. Let's assume that you always expect three words per line.
What should you do if only two words were to arrive?

Now -- if this is a _permitted and familiar_ agent behavior, then of course
you need to capture that and employ case discrimination.

If, however, this is not actually allowed ... then it is best to treat the line
as if it always contains three words, e.g. with:

[{python}]
----
def check_foobar(section):
    for foo, bar, baz in section:
        # ...
----

If there should ever be a line that does not consist of exactly three words,
a nice exception will be generated and you will receive the very helpful crash
report that was just mentioned.


=== Missing items

What if the agent outputs data correctly, but the item to be checked is missing?
So, like this, for example:

[{python}]
----
def check_foobar(item, section):
    for sector, used, slots in section:
        if item == sector:
            # ... Check state ...
            yield Result(...)
            return
----

If the item you are looking for is not there, the loop is run and Python just
falls out of the back at the end of the function without 'yielding' a
result. And that's exactly the correct procedure! Because {CMK} recognizes that
the item to be monitored is missing and with {UNKNOWN} generates the correct
status and a suitable standard text for it.


[#snmp]
== SNMP-based checks

=== The fundamentals

Developing checks that work with SNMP is very similar to agent-based checks,
except that you still need to specify which SNMP ranges (OIDs) the check requires.
If you don't as yet have any experience with SNMP, we strongly recommend reading
the article on link:snmp.html[Monitoring via SNMP] as preparation at this point.

The process of discovery and checking via SNMP is somewhat different from that
for a normal agent. B ecause unlike there -- where the agent sends all of the
relevant information on its own -- with SNMP we have to say exactly which data
ranges we require. A complete dump of all data would be theoretically possible
(via SNMP walk), but this process can take minutes for fast devices and
over an hour for complex switches. Thus, this is not viable for checking or even
for discovery. {CMK} therefore proceeds in a more targeted manner.


==== SNMP detection

Service detection is divided into two phases. First, the _SNMP detection_
is performed. This determines which plug-ins on the respective device are of
actual interest. To do this, a few SNMP OIDs are retrieved -- individually,
without a walk. The most important of these is the
`sysDescr` (OID: `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.0`). Under this OID, each SNMP
device holds a description of itself,
e.g. '`Cisco NX-OS(tm) n5000, Software (n5000-uk9),...`'.

Based on this text, you can already define for very many plug-ins whether they
can be useful for this application. If the text is still not specific enough,
further OIDs are fetched and checked. The result of the SNMP detection will then
be a list of candidates for check plug-ins.


==== Discovery

In the second step, the necessary monitoring data is fetched for each of these
candidates with SNMP walks. These are then combined into a table and provided to
the check's discovery function with the `section` argument, which then as
usual determines the items to be monitored.


==== Checking

When running checks, it is already known which plug-ins are to be executed for
the device and the SNMP detection is now omitted. Here the monitoring data
needed for the plug-ins are fetched immediately by SNMP walks and from it the
`section` argument for the check function is filled.


==== Summary

So what do you need to do differently with an SNMP check compared to an
agent-based one?

. You do not need a plug-in for the agent.
. You must define the single OIDs and search texts required for an SNMP detection.
. You have to define which SNMP areas must be fetched for monitoring.


=== A word about the MIBs

Before we continue, we want to say a word about the infamous SNMP MIBs, because
there are many prejudices about these. Right at the beginning, some good news:
{CMK} doesn't need them. Really! But they are an important aid in being able to
_develop_ an SNMP check.

So what is a MIB? Literally, the abbreviation means
_Management Information Base_ -- somewhat meaningless really.
To be concrete, a MIB is a quite easy to read text file which describes a
certain subtree in the SNMP world. Namely, it states which branch in the
tree -- that is, which _OID_ -- has which meaning. This includes a name for
the OID, a comment on what values it can take (e.g. for enumerated data types,
where things like 1=up, 2=down, etc. are defined) and sometimes a useful comment.

{CMK} provides a set of freely-available MIB files. These describe very general
areas in the global OID tree, but do not contain any vendor-specific areas.
Therefore they are of not much help for self-developed checks.

So try to find the MIB files relevant for your particular device somewhere on
the manufacturer's web pages or even on the device's management interface,
and install these in the {CMK} instance in `local/share/check_mk/mibs`.
You can then have SNMP walks convert OID numbers to names and can thus more
quickly find where the data of interest for your monitoring is located.
Also, MIBs, if done carefully, contain interesting information in their
comments, as we noted above. You can easily read an MIB file with a text editor
or with `less`.


=== Locating the correct OIDs

The crucial prerequisite for developing a plug-in is, of course, that you know
which OIDs contain the necessary information. The first step in doing this (if
the device doesn't refuse) is to perform a complete SNMP walk.
This will retrieve _all_ of the available data via SNMP.

{CMK} can accomplish this very easily for you. To do so, first include the
device (or one of the devices) for which you want to develop a plug-in into your
monitoring. Let's say this device is called `mydevice01`. Check in the
device's basic functions to make sure that it can be monitored.
As a minimum, the [.guihint]#SNMP Info# and [.guihint]#Uptime# services need to be found,
and probably at least one [.guihint]#Interface# as well.
This is how you make sure that SNMP access works cleanly.

Then switch to the command line in the ({CMK}) instance. Here you can perform a
complete walk with the following command. We recommend using the `-v`
(verbose) option when doing this for the very first time:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -v --snmpwalk mydevice01
mydevice01:
Walk on ".1.3.6.1.2.1"...3898 variables.
Walk on ".1.3.6.1.4.1"...6025 variables.
Wrote fetched data to /omd/sites/heute/var/check_mk/snmpwalks/mydevice01.
----

As mentioned earlier, such a complete walk can take minutes or even
hours -- although the latter is rare. So don't become nervous if it takes a
while to complete this process. The walk will be saved in the file
`var/check_mk/snmpwalks/mydevice01`.
This will be a easily-readable text file that starts something like this:

.var/check_mk/snmpwalks/mydevice01
[{file}]
----
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 JetStream 24-Port Gigabit L2 Managed Switch with 4 Combo SFP Slots
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11863.1.1.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 546522419
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 hh@example.com
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 sw-ks-01
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 Core Switch Serverraum klein
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0 3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0 27
----

In each line there is an OID and then its value. And right there in the first
line you find the most important one, namely the `sysDescr`.

Now the OIDs themselves are not very informative. If the correct MIBs are
installed, you can have them converted to names in a second step with
the `cmk --snmptranslate` command. It is best to redirect the result --
which would otherwise appear in the terminal -- to a file:

[{shell}]
----
OMD[heute]:~$ cmk --snmptranslate mydevice01  > translated
Processing 9923 lines.
finished.
----

The `translated` file reads like the original walk, but has a translated
value for the OID on each line after the `--&gt;`:

.translated
[{file}]
----
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 JetStream 24-Port Gigabit L2 Managed Switch with 4 Combo SFP Slots --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11863.1.1.3 --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 546522419 --> DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 hh@example.com --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 sw-ks-01 --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 Core Switch Serverraum klein --> SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1 1 --> IF-MIB::ifIndex.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.2 2 --> IF-MIB::ifIndex.2
----

Example: the OID `.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0` has the translated name
`SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0`. This is an important hint -- the rest is then
practice, experience and of course experimentation.


=== Registering the SNMP section

So, once you have determined the necessary OIDs, it's on to the actual
development of the plug-in. This is done in three steps:

. For an SNMP detection, specify which OIDs must contain which texts for your plug-in to run.
. Declare which OID branches need to be fetched for the monitoring.
. Write a check plug-in analogous to those for agent-based checks.

The first two steps are performed by registering an SNMP section.
You do this by calling `register.snmp_section()`. Here you specify at
least three arguments: the name of the section (`name`), the details for
the SNMP detect `detect`, and the OID branches needed for actually
monitoring (`fetch`). Here is an example of a hypthetical check plug-in
with the name `foo`:

.local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/foo.py
[{python}]
----
register.snmp_section(
    name = "foo",
    detect = startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foobar device"),
    fetch = SNMPTree(
        base = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.35424.1.2',
        oids = [
            '4.0',
            '5.0',
            '8.0',
        ],
    ),
)
----


==== The SNMP Detection

With the keyword `detect` you specify under which conditions the discovery
function should be executed. In our example, this is the case if the value of the
OID `.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.0` (i.e. the `sysDescr`) starts with the text
`foobar device` (case-insensitive in principle). In addition to
`startswith`, there are a number of other possible attributes. There is
also a negated form of each of these, which begins with `not_`:

[cols="28,33,~"]
|===
|Attribute |Negation |Function 

|equals(oid, needle) |not_equals(oid, needle) |The value of the OID is equal to the text `needle`
|contains(oid, needle) |not_contains(oid, needle) |The value of the OID at some point contains the text `needle`
|startswith(oid, needle) |not_startswith(oid, needle) |The value of the OID starts with the text `needle`
|endswith(oid, needle) |not_endswith(oid, needle) |The value of the OID ends with the text `needle`
|matches(oid, regex) |not_matches(oid, regex) |The value of OID matches the link:regexes.html[regular expression] `regex`, anchored at the start and at the end -- so with an exact match. If you only need a substring, just add another `pass:[.*]`
|exists(oid) |not_exists(oid) |Met if the OID is available on the device. The value may be empty.
|===


As well as the above, there is also the possibility of linking multiple tests with
`all_of` or `any_of`. The option `all_of` requires multiple
successful attributes for a positive discovery of the plug-in. The following
example finds the plug-in on a device if `sysDescr` starts with the text
`foo` (or `FOO` or `Foo`) *and* the
OID `.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.0` contains the text `.4.1.11863.`:

[{file}]
----
detect = all_of(
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo"),
    contains(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0", ".4.1.11863.")
)
----

The `any_of` option, on the other hand, is satisfied if any single one of
the criteria is met. Here is an example where different values are allowed for
the  `sysDescr` keyword:

[{file}]
----
detect = any_of(
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo version 3 system"),
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo version 4 system"),
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo version 4.1 system"),
)
----

By the way -- are you familiar with link:regexes.html[regular expressions]? If so, with
these you would probably simplify this whole process and still get by with just
a single line:

[{file}]
----
detect = matches(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "FOO Version (3|4|4.1) .*"),
----

And one more important note: The OIDs you specify in the `detect`
declaration from a plug-in will, in case of doubt, be fetched from *every*
device that is monitored via SNMP. Therefore, be very sparing in your use of
vendor-specific OIDs. Try to make your discovery absolutely exclusive to the
`sysDescr` (`.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0`) and the `sysObjectID`
(`.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0`). If you still need another different OID, then
reduce the number of devices where it is requested to a minimum by excluding as
many devices as possible beforehand using the `sysDescr`, e.g. like this:

[{file}]
----
detect = all_of(
    startswith(".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0", "foo"),   # first check sysDescr
    contains(".1.3.6.1.4.1.4455.1.3", "bar"),  # fetch vendor specific OID
)
----

The `all_of()` works in such a way that if the first condition fails,
the second is not even tried (and thus the OID in question is not fetched).
Here in the example, the OID `.1.3.6.1.4.1.4455.1.3` is fetched only for
those devices that have `foo` in their `sysDescr`.

What happens if you have made the declaration incorrectly or at least not quite
on target?

* If the detection erroneously detects devices that do not have the necessary OIDs, your discovery function will not generate any services -- so nothing 'bad' will happen. However, this will slow down the discovery on such devices, because now every time it will pointlessly try to retrieve the corresponding OIDs.
* If the detection does _not_ detect devices that are actually allowed, during the discovery no services will be found in the monitoring.


=== The OID ranges for monitoring

The most important part of the SNMP declaration is the specification of which
OIDs are to be fetched for the monitoring. In almost all cases, a plug-in only
needs selected branches from a single table to do this.
Let's consider the following example:

[{file}]
----
    fetch = SNMPTree(
        base = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.35424.1.2',
        oids = [
            '4.0',
            '5.0',
            '8.0',
        ],
    ),
----

The keyword `base` specifies an OID prefix here.
All necessary data is below. At `oids` you then specify a list of
sub-OIDs to be fetched from there. In the above example, a total of three SNMP
walks are then made, namely on starting from the OIDs
`.1.3.6.1.4.1.35424.1.2.4.0` and `.1.3.6.1.4.1.35424.1.2.5.0`
and `.1.3.6.1.4.1.35424.1.2.8.0`. It is important that these walks fetch
the same number of variables and that they also correspond to each other.
This means that, for example, the nth element from each of the walks corresponds
to the same monitored object.

Here is an example from the check plug-in `snmp_quantum_storage_info`:
[{file}]
----
    tree = SNMPTree(
       base=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2036.2.1.1",  # qSystemInfo
       oids=[
           "4",   # qVendorID
           "5",   # qProdId
           "6",   # qProdRev
           "12",  # qSerialNumber
       ],
    ),
)
----

Here, the vendor ID, the product ID, the product revision and the serial number
are retrieved from each storage device.

The discovery and check function is presented with this data as a table,
i.e. as a list of lists. The table is mirrored so that you have all of the data
for each item per entry in the outer list. Each entry has as many items as you
specified in `oids`.
This allows you to loop through the list in a very practical way, e.g.:

[{file}]
----
    for vendor_id, prod_id, prod_rev, serial_number in section:
        ...
----

Please note:

* All entries are _strings_, even if the OIDs in question are actually numbers.
* Missing OIDs are presented as empty strings.
* Remember the ability to output formatted data during development with `pprint`.


=== Other SNMP special features



We will describe here in the future:

* How to retrieve multiple independent SNMP areas.
* What OIDEnd() is all about
* Other special cases when dealing with SNMP


== Formatting numbers


=== The basics

In the summary or details for a service, numbers are often output. To make it as
easy as possible for you to format them nicely and correctly, and also to
standardize the output from all check plug-ins, there are helper functions for
rendering different kinds of sizes. All of these are sub-functions of the
`render` module and are consequently called with `render.`.
For example, `render.bytes(2000)` results in the text `1.95 KiB`.

What all of these functions have in common is that they get their values in a
so-called _canonical_ or natural unit. Thus one must never think, and there
are no difficulties or errors with the conversion. For example, times are always
given in seconds, and the sizes of hard disks, files, etc. are always given in
bytes and not in kilobytes, kibibytes, blocks or any other confusion of units.

Please use these functions even if you don't like the display so much.
After all, this is then consistent for the user. And future versions of {CMK}
may be able to change the display or even make it configurable for the user.
Your check plug-in will then also benefit from this.

Following the detailed description of all of the display functions
(render functions), you will find a summary of these in the form of a clear table.


=== Times, time spans, frequencies

Absolute time specifications (timestamps) are formatted with
`render.date()` or `render.datetime()`. The specifications are
always in _seconds from January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC_ -- the so-called
epoch time. This is also the format used by the Python function
`time.time()`. The advantage of this representation is that it can be
used to calculate very easily, for example, the duration of an operation if the
start and end times are known. The formula is then simply
`duration = end - start`. These calculations also work independently of
the time zone, daylight saving time changes or leap years.

`render.date()` outputs only the date, `render.datetime()` adds
the time. The output is done according to the current time zone for the (.CMK)
server that is running the check!

Examples:

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.date(0) |Jan 01 1970
|render.datetime(0) |Jan 01 1970 01:00:00
|render.date(1600000000) |Sep 13 2020
|render.datetime(1600000000) |Sep 13 2020 14:26:40
|===


Now please don't be surprised that `render.date(0)` outputs 01:00 as the
time instead of 00:00! This is because we are writing this manual in the time zone
for Germany, which is one hour ahead of UTC standard time (at least during
standard time, because, as you know, January 1 is not in (the European Summer)
daylight saving time)

For _timespan_ there is still the function `render.timespan()`.
This produces a duration in seconds and outputs it in a human readable form.
For larger time spans, seconds or minutes are omitted.



[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.timespan(1) |1 second
|render.timespan(123) |2 minutes 3 seconds
|render.timespan(12345) |3 hours 25 minutes
|render.timespan(1234567) |14 days 6 hours
|===


A _frequency_ is effectively the reciprocal of time.
The canonical unit is _Hz_, which is equivalent to once per second.
A field of application is, for example, for the clock rate of a CPU:

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.frequency(111222333444) |111 GHz
|===



=== Bytes

Whenever memory, files, hard disks, file systems and the like are concerned,
the canonical unit is the _byte_. Since computers usually organize such
things in powers of two, e.g. in units of 512, 1024 or 65536 bytes, from the
beginning it has been accepted that a _kilobyte_ is not 1000 but 1024 bytes.
This is in itself very practical, because in this way mostly round numbers
came out. The legendary Commodore C64 had a 64 kilobyte memory and not 65,536.

Unfortunately, at some point hard disk manufacturers came up with the idea of
specifying the sizes of their disks in 1000's of units. Since the difference
between 1000 and 1024 is 2.4% for each size, and these are multiplied,
a 1 GB disk (1024 times 1024 * 1024) suddenly becomes 1.07 GB. That sells better.

This annoying confusion persists to this day and continues to cause errors.
As a remedy, new prefixes based on the binary system were defined by the
International Electrotechnical Commission. Accordingly, nowadays a kilobyte is
officially 1000 bytes, and a _kibibyte_ is 1024 bytes (2 to the power of 10).
In addition one should say _Mebibyte_ and _Gibitbyte_ and
_Tebibyte_ (ever heard of these?). The abbreviations are (attention,
here at once always *i*, instead of *e*!) _KiB_, _MiB_,
_GiB_ and _TiB_.

{CMK} adapts itself to this standard and helps you with multiple adapted render
functions so that you can always produce correct outputs. So specifically for
hard disks and file systems there is the `render.disksize()` function,
which gives the output in powers of 1000.

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.disksize(1000) |1.00 kB
|render.disksize(1024) |1.02 kB
|render.disksize(2000000) |2.00 MB
|===


For the sizes of _files_ it is common to specify the exact size in
bytes _without rounding_. This has the advantage that you can see very
quickly if a file has changed even minimally or that two files are (probably)
the same. The `render.filesize()` function is responsible for this:

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.filesize(1000) |1,000 B
|render.filesize(1024) |1,024 B
|render.filesize(2000000) |2,000,000 B
|===


If you want to output a size that is not a disk or a file size, just use the
generic `render.bytes()`.
This will give you the output in the classic 1024's in the new official notation:

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.bytes(1000) |1000 B
|render.bytes(1024) |1.00 KiB
|render.bytes(2000000) |1.91 MiB
|===



=== Bandwidths and data rates

Networkers have their own terms and ways of expressing things. And as always,
in each domain {CMK}-tries hard to adopt the way of communicating that is
customary there. That's why there are three different rendering functions for
data rates and speeds. All of these have in common that the rates are passed in
_bytes per second_, even when the output is in bits!

`render.nicspeed()` represents the maximum speed of a network card or
switch port. Since they are not measured values, there is no need to do any
rounding. Although no port can send single bits, the specifications are in bits
for historical reasons. Attention: you must however always pass bytes per second
here as well!

Examples:

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.nicspeed(12500000) |100 MBit/s
|render.nicspeed(100000000) |800 MBit/s
|===


`render.networkbandwidth()` is for an actual measured transmission speed
on the network. The input value is again bytes per second (or 'octets' as a
networker would say):

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.networkbandwidth(123) |984 Bit/s
|render.networkbandwidth(123456) |988 kBit/s
|render.networkbandwidth(123456789) |988 MBit/s
|===


Where the network is not involved and data rates are nevertheless output,
bytes are again common. The most prominent examples are the IO rates of hard
disks. For this there is the render function `render.iobandwidth()`,
which in {CMK} works with powers of 1000:

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|Call |Output 

|render.iobandwidth(123) |123 B/s
|render.iobandwidth(123456) |123 kB/s
|render.iobandwidth(123456789) |123 MB/s
|===



=== Percentages

The `render.percent()` function represents a percentage value --
rounded to two decimal places. It is an exception to the other functions in that the
actual natural value -- that is, the ratio -- is not passed here, but really the
percentage.
So if something is half full, for example, rather than 0.5. you must pass 50.

Because it can sometimes be interesting to know whether a value is almost zero or exactly zero, values that are greater than zero but less than 0.01 are marked by adding a "<" sign.

// [#parameters]
// == Schwellwerte und Checkparameter
// 
// 
// === Eine Regelkette für das Setup
// 
// In einem unserer bisherigen Beispiele haben wir den Zustand {WARN}
// erzeugt, falls nur noch 10 oder weniger Slots frei waren. Dabei war die
// Zahl `10` direkt in der Checkfunktion fest einprogrammiert - hart codiert,
// wie Programmierer sagen würden. In {CMK} ist man allerdings als Anwender
// eher gewohnt, dass man solche Schwellwerte und Parameter per _Regel_
// konfigurieren kann. Deswegen wollen wir uns als nächstes ansehen, wie
// auch Sie Ihren Check so verbessern können, dass er über die Setup-Oberfläche
// konfigurierbar ist.
// 
// Dazu müssen wir zwei Fälle unterscheiden:
// 
// . Es gibt bereits eine passende Regelkette. Das kann eigentlich nur dann der Fall sein, wenn Ihr neuer Check etwas prüft, für das {CMK} in gleicher Form bereits Checkplugins hat, z.B. das Überwachen einer Temperatur. Dafür gibt es bereits eine Regelkette, die Sie direkt verwenden können.
// . Es gibt keine passende Regelkette. Dann müssen Sie eine neue anlegen.
// 
// === Verwenden von vorhandenen Regelketten
// 
// Die ausgelieferten Regelketten für Parameter von Checks finden Sie
// im Verzeichnis `lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/wato/check_parameters/`.
// Nehmen wir als Beispiel die Datei `memory_simple.py`. Diese
// deklariert eine Regelkette mit folgendem Abschnitt:
// 
// .lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/wato/check_parameters/memory_simple.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// rulespec_registry.register(
//     CheckParameterRulespecWithItem(
//         check_group_name="memory_simple",
//         group=RulespecGroupCheckParametersOperatingSystem,
//         item_spec=_item_spec_memory_simple,
//         match_type="dict",
//         parameter_valuespec=_parameter_valuespec_memory_simple,
//         title=lambda: _("Main memory usage of simple devices"),
//     ))
// ----
// 
// Entscheidend für Sie ist dabei das Schlüsselwort `check_group_name`,
// welches hier auf `"memory_simple"` gesetzt ist. Damit wird die Verbindung
// zum Checkplugin hergestellt. Das machen Sie beim Registrieren des Checks
// mit dem Schlüsselwort `check_ruleset_name`, zum Beispiel:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// register.check_plugin(
//     name = "foobar",
//     service_name = "Foobar Sector %s",
//     discovery_function = discover_foobar,
//     check_function = check_foobar,
//     check_ruleset_name="memory_simple",
//     check_default_parameters={},
// )
// ----
// 
// Zwingend notwendig ist dabei auch die Definition von Defaultparametern
// über das Schlüsselwort `check_default_parameters`. Diese Parameter
// gelten für Ihren Check dann, wenn der Benutzer noch keine Regel angelegt
// hat. Falls es keine verpflichtenden Parameter gibt, können Sie einfach
// das leere Dictionary `{}` als Wert nehmen.
// 
// Wie der jeweils vom Benutzer konfigurierte Wert dann bei der Checkfunktion
// ankommt, werden wir dann weiter unten sehen.
// 
// 
// === Eine eigene Regelkette definieren
// 
// Falls es keine passende Regelkette gibt (was wohl eher der Normalfall
// ist), müssen wir uns selbst eine neue erzeugen. Dazu legen wir
// eine Datei im Verzeichnis `local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/wato`
// an. Der Name der Datei sollte sich an dem des Checks orientieren und
// er muss wie alle Plugindateien die Endung `.py` haben.
// 
// Sehen wir uns den Aufbau so einer Datei Schritt für Schritt an.
// Zunächst kommen einige Importbefehle. Falls die Texte in Ihrer
// Datei in andere Sprachen übersetzbar sein sollen, importieren
// Sie `_` (Unterstrich). Dies ist eine Funktion und fungiert als Markierung
// für alle übersetzbaren
// Texte. Im Weiteren schreiben Sie dann z.B. anstelle
// von `"Threshold for warn"` ein `_("Threshold for warn")`.
// Das Übersetzungssystem von {CMK}, welches auf 
// https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#module-gettext[gettext]
// basiert, findet
// solche Texte und übernimmt sie in die Liste der zu übersetzenden Texte
// auf. Falls Sie den Check nur für sich selbst bauen, können Sie darauf
// auch verzichten und brauchen den folgenden Importbefehl nicht:
// 
// .local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/wato/foobar_parameters.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// from cmk.gui.i18n import _
// ----
// 
// Als nächstes importieren wir sogenannte _ValueSpecs_. Ein ValueSpec
// ist ein sehr praktisches und universelles Werkzeug, das {CMK} an vielen
// Stellen verwendet. Es dient dem Generieren von angepassten Eingabemasken,
// der Darstellung und Validierung der eingegebenen Werte und der Umwandlung
// in Python-Datenstrukturen. In folgendem Beispiel werden `Dictionary`,
// `Integer` und `TextAscii` importiert.
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// from cmk.gui.valuespec import (
//     Dictionary,
//     Integer,
//     TextAscii,
// )
// ----
// 
// Das `Dictionary` benötigen Sie auf jeden Fall. Denn seit Version
// {v20} von {CMK} ist es zwingend vorgeschrieben, dass Checkparameter
// Python-Dictionaries sein müssen. Früher konnte es z.B. auch ein Paar (Tupel
// aus zwei Zahlen) sein (z.B. Warn/Crit).
// 
// `Integer` ist für die Eingabe einer Zahl ohne Kommastellen
// verantwortlich und `TextAscii` für einen Text, bei dem nur ASCII-Zeichen
// erlaubt sein sollen (keine Unicode-Zeichen).
// 
// Als nächstes werden noch Symbole importiert, die beim Registrieren
// benötigt werden:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// from cmk.gui.plugins.wato import (
//     CheckParameterRulespecWithItem,
//     rulespec_registry,
//     RulespecGroupCheckParametersOperatingSystem,
// )
// ----
// 
// Falls Ihr Check kein Item hat, importieren Sie stattdessen
// `CheckParameterRulespecWithoutItem`. Zur `RulespecGroup`....
// schreiben wir weiter unten noch etwas.
// 
// 
// Nun kommen die eigentlichen Definitionen. Zunächst deklarieren wir
// ein Eingabefeld, mit dem der Benutzer das _Item_ des Checks angeben
// kann. Dies ist für die Regelbedingung notwendig, und auch für das manuelle
// Anlegen von Checks, welche ohne Discovery funktionieren sollen. Das erledigen
// wir mit `TextAscii`. Dieses bekommt per `title` einen Titel
// zugewiesen, welcher dann in der Regel als Überschrift für das Eingabefeld
// angezeigt wird:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def _item_valuespec_foobar():
//     return TextAscii(title=_("Sector name"))
// ----
// 
// Den Namen der Funktion, welche diese ValueSpec zurückgibt, können
// Sie frei wählen, er wird nur an der Stelle weiter unten benötigt.
// Damit er nicht über die Modulgrenze hinaus sichtbar wird, sollte er
// mit einem Unterstrich beginnen.
// 
// Als nächstes kommt das ValueSpec für die Eingabe des eigentlichen
// Checkparameters. Auch hierfür legen wir eine Funktion an, welche
// dieses erzeugt. Das `return Dictionary(...)` ist vorgeschrieben.
// Innerhalb dessen legen Sie mit `elements=[...]` die Liste
// der Unterparameter für diesen Check an. In unserem Beispiel gibt
// es nur einen: die Warnschwelle für die freien Slots. Dies soll
// eine Ganzzahl sein, also verwenden wir hier ein `Integer`.
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def _parameter_valuespec_foobar():
//     return Dictionary(
//         elements=[
//             ("warning_lower", Integer(title=_("Warning below free slots"),
//         ],
//     )
// ----
// 
// Zu guter Letzt registrieren wir jetzt mithilfe der importierten und
// selbstdefinierten Dinge eine neue Regelkette. Dazu gibt es die
// Funktion `rulespec_registry.register()`:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// rulespec_registry.register(
//     CheckParameterRulespecWithItem(
//         check_group_name="foobar",
//         group=RulespecGroupCheckParametersOperatingSystem,
//         match_type="dict",
//         item_spec=_item_ValueSpec_foobar,
//         parameter_valuespec=_parameter_valuespec_foobar,
//         title=lambda: _("Free slots for Foobar sectors"),
//     ))
// ----
// 
// Dazu noch einige Hinweise:
// 
// * Falls Ihr Check kein Item verwendet, lautet die innere Funktion `CheckParameterRulespecWithoutItem`. Die Zeile `item_spec` entfällt dann.
// * Wie oben erwähnt stellt der `check_group_name` die Verbindung zu den Checks her, welche diese Regel verwenden sollen. Er darf auf keinen Fall identisch sein mit einer bereits existierenden Regel, weil diese damit überschrieben würde.
// * Die `group` legt fest, in welcher Kategorie im Setup die Regelkette auftauchen soll. Die meisten dieser Gruppen sind in der Datei `lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/wato/utils/__init__.py` definiert. Dort finden Sie auch Beispiele, wie Sie eine eigene neue Gruppe anlegen können.
// * Der `match_type` ist immer `"dict"`. In älteren {CMK}-Versionen gab es auch Parameterregeln mit anderen Typen.
// * `title` legt den Titel der Regelkette fest, wird aber nicht direkt als Text, sondern als ausführbare Funktion angegeben, welche den Text zurückliefert (deswegen das `lambda:`).
// 
// 
// ==== Test
// 
// Wenn Sie diese Datei angelegt haben, sollten Sie erstmal ausprobieren, ob alles soweit
// funktioniert und nicht gleich mit der Checkfunktion weiterarbeiten. Dazu müssen
// Sie erstmal den Apache der Instanz neu starten, damit die neue Datei gelesen wird.
// Das macht der Befehl:
// 
// [{shell}]
// ----
// {c-omd} omd restart apache
// ----
// 
// Danach sollte die Regelkette im Setup zu finden sein. Legen Sie eine Regel
// in dieser Kette an und probieren Sie verschiedene Werte aus. Wenn
// das ohne Fehler geht, können Sie die Checkparameter jetzt in der Checkfunktion
// verwenden.
// 
// === Die Regel im Checkplugin benutzen
// 
// Damit die Regel zum Greifen kommt, müssen wir dem Checkplugin erlauben,
// Checkparameter entgegenzunehmen und ihm sagen, welche Regel benutzt
// werden soll. Dazu muss bei der Registrierung der Eintrag `check_default_parameters`
// unbedingt vorhanden sein. Im einfachsten Fall übergeben wir ein leeres Dictionary.
// 
// Als zweites übergeben wir der Registrierungsfunktion noch den
// `check_ruleset_name`, also den Namen, den wir oben mittels
// `check_group_name` an die Regelkette vergeben haben. So weiß {CMK}
// aus welcher Regelkette die Parameter bestimmt werden sollen.
// 
// Das Ganze sieht dann z.B. so aus:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// register.check_plugin(
//     name = "foobar",
//     service_name = "Foobar Sector %s",
//     discovery_function = discover_foobar,
//     check_function = check_foobar,
//     check_default_parameters={},
//     check_ruleset_name="foobar",
// )
// ----
// 
// Nun wird {CMK} versuchen, der Checkfunktion Parameter zu übergeben. Damit
// das klappen kann, müssen wir die Checkfunktion so erweitern, dass sie als
// zweites das Argument `params` erwartet. Diese schiebt sich zwischen
// `item` und `section` (Falls Sie einen Check ohne Item bauen,
// entfällt das `item` natürlich und `params` steht am Anfang):
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def check_foobar(item, params, section):
// ----
// 
// Es ist sehr empfehlenswert, sich jetzt als ersten Test den
// Inhalt der Variable `params` mit einem `print`
// ausgeben zu lassen (oder `pprint`, wenn Sie es etwas
// komfortabler haben wollen). Legen Sie verschiedene Regeln an, probieren
// Sie, welche Werte bei `params` ankommen:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def check_foobar(item, params, section):
//     print(params)
//     for sector, used, slots in ...
// ----
// 
// Und ganz wichtig: Wenn alles fertig ist, entfernen Sie unbedingt die
// `print`-Befehle wieder! Diese können die interne Kommunikation
// von {CMK} durcheinanderbringen.
// 
// 
// Nun passen wir unsere Checkfunktion an, so dass der übergebene Parameter
// seine Wirkung entfalten kann. Wir holen uns den Wert mit dem in der Regel
// gewählten Key (hier `"warning_lower"`) aus den Parametern:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def check_foobar(item, params, section):
//     warn = params["warning_lower"]
//     for sector, used, slots in section:
//         if sector == item:
//             used = int(used)    # convert string to int
//             slots = int(slots)  # convert string to int
//             if used == slots:
//                 s = State.CRIT
//             elif slots - used <= warn:
//                 s = State.WARN
//             else:
//                 s = State.OK
//             yield Result(
//                 state = s,
//                 summary = f"used {used} out of {slots} slots")
//             return
// ----
// 
// Falls eine Regel konfiguriert ist, können wir nun die „freien Slots“ in
// unserem Beispiel überwachen. Wenn allerdings keine Regel definiert ist,
// wird diese Checkfunktion crashen: Da die Default-Parameter des Plugins nicht
// befüllt sind, wird das Plugin bei Abwesenheit einer Regel einen `KeyError`
// erzeugen.
// 
// Dieses Problem können wir beheben, indem wir bei der Registrierung einen
// passenden Parameter einfügen:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// register.check_plugin(
//     name = "foobar",
//     service_name = "Foobar Sector %s",
//     discovery_function = discover_foobar,
//     check_function = check_foobar,
//     check_default_parameters = {"warning_lower": 10},
//     check_ruleset_name = "foobar",
// )
// ----
// 
// Sie sollten Defaultwerte immer auf diese Weise übergeben (und den Fall
// fehlender Parameter nicht im Checkplugin abfangen), da diese Defaultparameter
// auch in der Setup-Oberfläche angezeigt werden können. Dazu gibt es z.B.
// auf der Servicekonfigurationsseite eines Hosts im Menu [.guihint]#View# den Eintrag
// [.guihint]#Show Check parameters#.
// 
// Ein einzelner Wert als Schwellwert ist in {CMK} übrigens sehr unüblich. Da
// Services in den Zuständen {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT} sein können, ist es
// naheliegend die Parameter immer als `Tuple` mit zwei Einträgen zu
// definieren, also als Paar von Schwellen für {WARN} und {CRIT}. Dazu passen
// wir die Regelkette wie folgt an:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def _parameter_valuespec_foobar():
//     return Dictionary(
//         elements=[
//             ("warning_lower", Tuple(
//                 title=_("Levels on free slots"),
//                 elements=[
//                     Integer(title=_("Warning below")),
//                     Integer(title=_("Critical below")),
//                 ],
//             )),
//         ],
//     )
// ----
// 
// Beachten Sie, dass eine solche Änderung des Datentyps eine inkompatible
// Änderung darstellt: Existierende Regeln können jetzt nicht mehr von der
// Oberfläche geladen werden. Und auch die Checkfunktion kann auf Probleme
// stoßen, wenn anstelle eines erwarteten Paar von zwei Zahlen eine einzelne
// Zahl in `params` steht. Sie können solche Regeln einfach editieren.
// Beim erneuten Speichern wird dann das neue Format verwendet.
// 
// === Weitere ValueSpecs
// 
// In {CMK} gibt es zahlreiche ValueSpecs für alle möglichen Situationen.
// Hier sind noch ein paar nützliche:
// 
// ==== Float
// 
// `Float` ist wie `Integer`, erlaubt aber die Eingabe
// von Zahlen mit Nachkommastellen.
// 
// ==== Percentage
// 
// Oft möchte man Schwellen nicht in absoluten Zahlen, sondern in Prozent angeben.
// Dazu gibt es das ValueSpec `Percentage`:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def _parameter_value_spec_foobar():
//     return Dictionary(
//         elements=[
//             ("levels_percent", Tuple(
//                 title=_("Relative levels"),
//                 elements=[
//                     Percentage(title=_("Warning at"), default_value=80),
//                     Percentage(title=_("Critical at"), default_value=90)
//                 ],
//             )),
//         ],
//     )
// ----
// 
// Bei dieser ValueSpec würde das Checkplugin die Parameter `{"levels_percent":
// (80.0, 90.0)}` übergeben bekommen.
// 
// ==== MonitoringState
// 
// Der `MonitoringState` ist nützlich, wenn Sie dem Benutzer erlauben
// wollen, für verschiedene Situationen jeweils einen der Zustände {OK},
// {WARN}, {CRIT} und {UNKNOWN} auszuwählen. Es bietet dem Benutzer ein
// Dropdownfeld mit eben diesen vier Möglichkeiten, welche dann umgesetzt
// werden in eine der Zahlen `0`, `1`, `2` oder `3`.
// 
// Hier können Sie z.B.  einstellen, welchen Zustand der Service bekommen soll,
// falls kein Backup konfiguriert bzw. vorhanden ist:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def _parameter_valuespec_plesk_backups():
//     return Dictionary(
//         help=_("This check monitors backups configured for domains in plesk."),
//         elements=[
//             ("no_backup_configured_state",
//              MonitoringState(title=_("State when no backup is configured"), default_value=1)),
//             ("no_backup_found_state",
//              MonitoringState(title=_("State when no backup can be found"), default_value=1)),
//         ...
// ----
// 
// Bei dieser ValueSpec würde das Checkplugin die Parameter
// `{"no_backup_configured_state": 1, "no_backup_found_state": 1}` übergeben
// bekommen, falls in beiden Fällen der Default von {WARN} (=1) übernommen wurde.
// Sie können die Zahl einfach in ein `State` Objekt umwandeln, indem Sie es
// der Funktion `State()` übergeben:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
//     yield Result(
//         state=State(params["no_backup_configured_state"]),
//         summary="No backup is configured!",
//     )
// ----
// 
// 
// ==== Age
// 
// Das Feld `Age` erlaubt die Eingabe eines Alters, welches intern
// als Anzahl von Sekunden gespeichert und übergeben wird:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def _parameter_valuespec_antivir_update_age():
//     return Tuple(elements=[
//         Age(title=_("Warning level for time since last update")),
//         Age(title=_("Critical level for time since last update")),
//     ],)
// ----
// 
// 
// ==== Filesize
// 
// Die ValueSpec `Filesize` erlaubt die Eingabe von Datei- (oder
// Festplatten)größen. Intern wird mit Bytes gerechnet, aber der Benutzer
// darf aus KB, MB, GB oder TB auswählen:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
//     Tuple(
//         title=_("Maximum size of all files on backup space"),
//         help=_("The maximum size of all files on the backup space. "
//                "This might be set to the allowed quotas on the configured "
//                "FTP server to be notified if the space limit is reached."),
//         elements=[
//             Filesize(title=_("Warning at")),
//             Filesize(title=_("Critical at")),
//         ],
//     ),
// ----
// 
// Das Thema ValueSpecs ist extrem flexibel und umfangreich und
// würde diesen Artikel sprengen. Bitte schauen Sie sich die
// Beispiele der von {CMK} mitausgelieferten Regeldefinitionen in
// `lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/wato/check_parameters/` an. Dort gibt es
// mehr als 500 Dateien mit Beispielen.
// 
// 
// == Angepasste Darstellung von Metriken
// 
// === Der Sinn von Metrikdefinitionen
// 
// In unserem obigen Beispiel haben wir das Plugin `foobar` die Metrik `fooslots`
// erzeugen lassen. Metriken werden in der grafischen Oberfläche von {CMK} sofort
// sichtbar, ohne dass Sie etwas dafür tun müssten.
// Pro Metrik wird bei den Servicedetails automatisch ein Graph erzeugt.
// 
// Allerdings gibt es dabei ein paar Einschränkungen:
// 
// * Es erscheint nicht automatisch ein „Perf-O-Meter“, also die grafische balkenartige Vorschau des Messwerts, wenn der Service in der Listendarstellung angezeigt wird (z.B. in der Ansicht, die alle Services eines Hosts darstellt).
// * Es werden nicht automatisch passende Metriken in einem Graphen kombiniert, sondern jede erscheint einzeln.
// * Die Metrik hat keinen richtigen Titel, sondern es wird der interne Variablenname der Metrik gezeigt.
// * Es wird keine Einheit verwendet, die eine sinnvolle Darstellung erlaubt (z.B. GB anstelle von einzelnen Bytes)
// * Es wir zufällig eine Farbe ausgewählt.
// 
// Um die Darstellung Ihrer Metriken in diesen Belangen zu vervollständigen,
// benötigen Sie noch einige Definitionen in einer weiteren Datei.
// 
// === Vorhandene Metrikdefinitionen verwenden
// 
// Bevor Sie das tun, sollten Sie -- ähnlich wie bei der Regelkette für
// die Parameter -- zunächst prüfen, ob {CMK} nicht bereits eine geeignete
// Metrikdefinition mitbringt.  Die vordefinierten Metrikendefinitionen finden
// Sie im Verzeichnis `lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/metrics/`. In der Datei `cpu.py`
// finden Sie beispielsweise eine Metrik für freien Platz eines Dateisystems:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// metric_info["util"] = {
//     "title": _("CPU utilization"),
//     "unit": "%",
//     "color": "26/a",
// }
// ----
// 
// Falls diese für Ihr Plugin geeignet ist, müssen Sie lediglich in Ihrem
// Aufruf der `Metric()`-Klasse den Namen `"util"` verwenden.
// Alles andere leitet sich dann automatisch davon ab.
// 
// === Eigene Metrikdefinitionen
// 
// Falls keine passende Metrik dabei ist, legen Sie einfach selbst
// eine an.  In unserem Beispiel wollen wir einen eigene Metrik für
// unsere `fooslots` definieren. Dazu legen wir eine Datei in
// `local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics` an`:
// 
// .local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics/foobar_metric.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// from cmk.gui.i18n import _
// from cmk.gui.plugins.metrics import metric_info
// 
// metric_info["fooslots"] = {
//     "title": _("Used slots"),
//     "unit": "count",
//     "color": "15/a",
// }
// ----
// 
// Dazu einige Hinweise:
// 
// * Der Schlüssel (hier `"fooslots"`) ist der Metrikname und muss dem entsprechen, was die Checkfunktion ausgibt.
// * Das Importieren und Verwenden des Unterstrichs für die Internationalisierung ist optional, wie bereits bei den Regeln besprochen.
// * Welche Unit-Definitionen es gibt, erfahren Sie in der Datei `lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/metrics/unit.py`.
// * Die Farbdefinition verwendet eine Palette. Zu jeder Palettenfarbe gibt es `/a` und `/b`. Dies sind zwei Schattierungen der gleichen Farbe. In den vorhandenen Definitionen werden Sie auch viele direkte Farbkodierungen wie `"#ff8800"` finden. Diese werden nach und nach abgeschafft und alle durch Palettenfarben ersetzt werden, da diese ein einheitlicheres Aussehen bieten und auch leichter an die Themes der Oberfläche angepasst werden können.
// 
// Diese Definition sorgt jetzt dafür, dass Farbe, Titel und Einheit der Metrik
// nach unsere Wünschen angezeigt werden.
// 
// === Graphen mit mehreren Metriken
// 
// Möchten Sie mehrere Metriken in einem Graphen kombinieren (was oft sehr sinnvoll ist),
// benötigen Sie, einfach in der gleichen Datei, eine Graphdefinition. Dies geschieht über
// das globale Dictionary `graph_info`.
// 
// Nehmen wir dazu als Beispiel an, unser Check hätte zwei Metriken und zwar `fooslots`
// und `fooslots_free`. Die Metrikdefinitionen wären z.B.:
// 
// .local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics/foobar_metric.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// from cmk.gui.i18n import _
// from cmk.gui.plugins.metrics import (
//     metric_info,
//     graph_info,
// )
// 
// metric_info["fooslots"] = {
//     "title": _("Used slots"),
//     "unit": "count",
//     "color": "16/a",
// }
// 
// metric_info["fooslots_free"] = {
//     "title": _("Free slots"),
//     "unit": "count",
//     "color": "24/a",
// }
// ----
// 
// Nun fügen wir einen Graphen an, der diese beiden Metriken als Linien einzeichnet:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// graph_info["fooslots_combined"] = {
//     "metrics": [
//         ("fooslots", "line"),
//         ("fooslots_free", "line"),
//     ],
// }
// ----
// 
// Hinweise dazu:

// === Darstellung der Metriken im Perf-O-Meter
// 
// 
// Möchten Sie zu unserer Metrik noch ein Perf-O-Meter in der
// Servicezeile anzeigen, benötigen Sie eine weitere Datei, diesmal
// im Verzeichnis `local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/perfometer`.
// Beispiel:
// 
// .local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/perfometer/foobar_perfometer.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// from cmk.gui.plugins.metrics import perfometer_info
// 
// perfometer_info.append({
//     "type": "logarithmic",
//     "metric": "fooslots",
//     "half_value": 5,
//     "exponent": 2.0,
// })
// ----
// 
// Perf-O-Meter sind etwas trickreicher als Graphen, da es keine Legende
// gibt. Und deswegen ist das mit dem Wertebereich schwierig. Da das arme
// Perf-O-Meter nicht wissen kann, welche Messwerte denn überhaupt möglich
// sind und der Platz sehr begrenzt ist, verwenden viele eingebaute Checkplugins
// eine logarithmische Darstellung. Dies ist auch in unserem Beispiel so.
// `half_value` ist der Messwert, welcher genau in der Mitte des
// Perf-O-Meters angezeigt wird. Bei einem Wert von `5`, wäre also
// hier der Balken halb gefüllt. Und `exponent` beschreibt den
// Faktor, welcher notwendig ist, damit weitere 10% des Bereichs gefüllt würden.
// Also würde hier im Beispiel ein Messwert von `10` bei 60% und einer
// von `20` bei 70% angezeigt werden.
// 
// Der Vorteil von dieser Methode: Wenn Sie eine Liste von Services gleicher
// Art haben, können Sie alle Perf-O-Meter untereinander optisch schnell
// vergleichen, da alle die gleiche Skala haben. Und trotz der sehr kleinen
// Darstellungen kann man sowohl bei sehr kleinen als auch bei der großen
// Messwerten die Unterschiede gut erkennen. Dafür sind die Werte allerdings nicht
// maßstabsgetreu.
// 
// Alternativ können Sie auch ein lineares Perf-O-Meter verwenden. Das
// ist immer dann sinnvoll, wenn es einen bekannten Maximalwert gibt.
// Ein typischer Fall sind Messwerte, welche Prozente von 0 bis 100
// darstellen. Das sähe dann z.B. so aus:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// perfometer_info.append({
//     "type": "linear",
//     "segments": ["fooslots_used_percent"],
//     "total": 100.0,
// })
// ----
// 
// Hier gibt es noch einen weiteren Unterschied zur logarithmischen
// Darstellung: `segments` ist hier eine Liste und erlaubt das
// nebeneinander Darstellen von mehreren Metriken.
// 
// Wie immer finden Sie Beispiele in den vielen von {CMK} ausgelieferten
// Plugins. Diese sind ebenfalls in den Dateien im Verzeichnis
// `lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/metrics`.


== Notes for users of the old API

Are you already experienced in developing check plug-ins with the previous
API -- the one up to version {v16} of {CMK}?
Then you will find some notes about important changes summarized here.


=== saveint() and savefloat()

The two functions `saveint()` and `savefloat()` have been dropped.
As a reminder, `saveint(x)` returns `0` if `x` cannot be
reasonably converted to a number, e.g. because it is an empty string or does not
consist only of digits.

While there have been a few good use cases for this, it has been used incorrectly
in the majority of cases, which in the past has resulted in many
link:devel_check_plugins.html#errors[errors] being obscured.

In a situation in which you want to get a `0` on an empty string --
which is the most common 'good' use case of `saveint(x)` -- you
can simply code the following:

[{file}]
----
foo = int(x) if x else 0
----

For `savefloat()` everything applies analogously.


// [#parsefunction]
// == Komplexe Agentenausgaben mittels Parsefunktion bändigen
// 
// Der nächste Schritt ist die sogenannten _Parsefunktion_. Diese
// hat die Aufgabe, die „rohen“ Agentendaten zu parsen und in eine logisch
// aufgeräumte Form zu bringen, die für alle weiteren Schritte einfach
// zu verarbeiten ist. Konvention ist, dass diese nach der Agentensektion
// benannt wird und mit `parse_` beginnt. Sie bekommt als einziges
// Argument `string_table`. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Sie hier nicht
// frei in der Wahl des Arguments sind. Es muss wirklich so heißen.
// 
// Wir schreiben unsere Parsefunktion jetzt erstmal so, dass wir einfach
// nur die Daten, die sie bekommt, auf der Konsole ausgeben. Dazu nehmen
// wir einfach die `print`-Funktion (Achtung: seit Python 3 sind
// hier Klammern zwingend notwendig):
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def parse_linux_usbstick(string_table):
//     print(string_table)
// ----
// 
// Damit das Ganze irgendetwas bewirken soll, müssen wir unsere Parsefunktion
// und überhaupt die neue Agentensektion bei {CMK} bekannt machen. Dazu
// rufen wir eine Registrierfunktion auf:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// register.agent_section(
//     name = "linux_usbstick",
//     parse_function = parse_linux_usbstick,
// )
// ----
// 
// Hier ist es wichtig, dass der Name der Sektion wirklich exakt mit dem
// Sektionsheader in der Agentenausgabe übereinstimmt. Insgesamt
// sieht das jetzt so aus:
// 
// .local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/linux_usbstick.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// from .agent_based_api.v1 import *
// 
// def parse_linux_usbstick(string_table):
//     print(string_table)
//     return string_table
// 
// register.agent_section(
//     name = "linux_usbstick",
//     parse_function = parse_linux_usbstick,
// )
// ----
// 
// Von diesem Moment an bekommt jedes Plugin, das die Section `linux_usbstick`
// benutzt, den Rückgabewert der Parsefunktion übergeben. In der Regel wird das das
// gleichnamige Checkplugin sein.
// 
// Wir haben jetzt gewissermaßen das einfachste mögliche Plugin gebaut, was noch
// keinen wirklich Nutzen hat, aber das wir immerhin schon testen können.  Dazu
// stoßen wir auf der Kommandozeile eine Serviceerkennung (Option `-I`)
// von dem Host an, dessen Agenten wir vorhin präpariert haben. _Wenn_
// dessen Ausgabe auch wirklich eine Sektion `linux_usbstick` enthält,
// dann müssten wir unsere Debugausgabe sehen:
// 
// [{shell}]
// ----
// {c-omd} cmk -I myhost123
// [['ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191'], ['wwn-0x5002538655584d30']]
// ----
// 
// Etwas übersichtlicher wird die Ausgabe, wenn wir das einfache `print`
// durch ein Pretty-print aus dem Modul `pprint` ersetzen. Das ist für
// alle weitere Debugausgaben sehr empfehlenswert:
// 
// .local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/linux_usbstick.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// from .agent_based_api.v1 import *
// *import pprint*
// 
// def parse_linux_usbstick(string_table):
//     *pprint.pprint(string_table)*
//     return string_table
// 
// register.agent_section(
//     name = "linux_usbstick",
//     parse_function = parse_linux_usbstick,
// )
// ----
// 
// Das sieht dann so aus:
// 
// [{shell}]
// ----
// {c-omd} cmk -I myhost123
// [['ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191'],
//  ['wwn-0x5002538655584d30']]
// ----
// 
// 
// === Die Parsefunktion schreiben
// 
// Wenn Sie genau hinsehen, dann erkennen Sie, dass es sich hier um verschachtelte
// Listen handelt. Im Argument `string_table` bekommen Sie eine Liste,
// welche _pro Zeile_ der Agentenausgabe eine Liste von _Worten_
// beinhaltet. Dabei werden die Zeilen an Folgen von Leerzeichen getrennt. Da
// unsere Sektion pro Zeile nur ein Wort enthält, bestehen ergo die inneren
// Listen aus nur jeweils einem Eintrag.
// 
// Folgendes Beispiel macht die Struktur noch etwas klarer:
// 
// .local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/linux_usbstick.py
// [{file}]
// ----
// from .agent_based_api.v1 import *
// import pprint
// 
// def parse_linux_usbstick(string_table):
//     print("Number of lines: %d" % len(string_table))
//     print("Number of words in first line: %d" % len(string_table[0]))
//     print("Length of first word: %d" % len(string_table[0][0]))
//     return string_table
// 
// register.agent_section(
//     name = "linux_usbstick",
//     parse_function = parse_linux_usbstick,
// )
// ----
// 
// Die Ausgabe sieht dann so aus:
// 
// [{shell}]
// ----
// {c-omd} cmk -I myhost123
// Number of lines: 3
// Number of words in first line: 1
// Length of first word: 36
// ----
// 
// Für unser Beispiel benötigen wir einfach nur eine einfache Liste der Devicenamen.
// Also machen wir unsere Parsefunktion so, dass sie aus jeder Zeile das eine Wort
// auspackt und in eine hübsche neue Liste verpackt:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def parse_linux_usbstick(string_table):
//     parsed = []
//     for line in string_table:
//         parsed.append(line[0])
//     pprint.pprint(parsed)
//     return string_table
// ----
// 
// Die Debugausgabe sieht dann so aus (bitte schauen Sie genau hin, es
// gibt jetzt nur noch ein einziges paar eckiger Klammern):
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// ['ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0512F_S1K5NYBF810191',
//  'wwn-0x5002538655584d30']
// ----
// 
// Damit die Parsefunktion vollständig ist, müssen wir jetzt noch die
// Debugmeldung entfernen und -- ganz wichtig -- das neue Ergebnis mit
// `return` zurückgeben:
// 
// [{file}]
// ----
// def parse_linux_usbstick(string_table):
//     parsed = []
//     for line in string_table:
//         parsed.append(line[0])
//     return parsed
// ----
// 
// Natürlich müssen von diesem Moment an alle betroffenen Plugins mit dem neuen
// Datenformat arbeiten können.
// 
// 
// == Ausblick
// 
// Es gibt noch viele weitere Aspekte und Themen rund um die Entwicklung von
// eigenen Plugins. {CMK} hat sehr viele Schnittstellen für eigene Erweiterungen
// und ist dadurch sehr flexibel erweiterbar. Wir arbeiten daran, dass diese
// Schnittstellen nach und nach im Handbuch beschrieben werden.
// 
// Falls Sie Fragen oder Schwierigkeiten haben, steht Ihnen natürlich unser professioneller
// Support und auch das kostenlose Forum zur Verfügung.
