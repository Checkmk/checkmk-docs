include::global_attr.adoc[]

A view offers access in monitoring to various displays of hosts, services or other objects under a certain perspective as a table.

Such a view can have a context -- for example, if it shows all of the services running on the `mycmkserver` host. 
Other views work globally -- for example, the view that shows you all of the services that currently have a problem.

All of the *global* views can be opened from the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, below the respective topic, for instance [.guihint]#All hosts#, [.guihint]#Service problems# or [.guihint]#Host & service events#.
After clicking on one of these menu items, the corresponding view is displayed in the main page -- in the following example [.guihint]#Service problems#:

In a view you have numerous control options, among others:

* You can navigate to other views by clicking on specific cells -- such as the host name or one of the services in the above example.

* By clicking on a column's title, you can sort by that column.

* The menu [.guihint]#Display > Modify display options# shows some settings for customizing the view. 
[.guihint]#Number of columns# lets you choose in how many tables the objects are displayed next to each other in the view (e.g. to make full use of your wide screen). In the example above the value is set to `1`.
With [.guihint]#Refresh interval# you can set the number of seconds after which the view is automatically reloaded -- after all, status data can change at any time.

* You can reduce the number of table entries after clicking [.guihint]#Filter# with the *filter bar* -- which is not really necessary in the example shown, but which is very helpful with long tables.
