include::global_attr.adoc[]

A view offers access in monitoring to various displays of hosts, services or other objects under a certain perspective as a table.

Such a view can have a context -- for example, if it shows all of the services running on the `mycmkserver` host. 
Other views work globally -- for example, the view that shows you all of the services that currently have a problem.

All of the *global* views can be opened from the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, below the respective topic, for instance [.guihint]#All Hosts#, [.guihint]#Service problems# or [.guihint]#{CMK} sites#. 
After clicking on one of these menu items, the corresponding view is displayed in the main page -- in the following example [.guihint]#Service problems#:

In a view you have numerous control options, among others:

* You can navigate to other views by clicking on specific cells -- such as the host name or one of the services in the above example.

* By clicking on a column's title, you can sort by that column.

* The menu [.guihint]#Display > Modify display options# shows some settings for customising the view. 
In the [.guihint]#Number of columns# list you can change the number of columns displayed -- e.g. to make full use of your wide screen -- and in the [.guihint]#Refresh interval# list you can set the number of seconds after which the view is automatically reloaded -- after all, status data can change at any time.

* You can reduce the number of table entries after clicking [.guihint]#Filter# with the *filter bar* -- which is not really necessary in the example shown, but which is very helpful with long tables.
