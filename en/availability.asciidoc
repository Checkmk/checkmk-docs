== The basic principle

=== A look back into the past

[{image-left}]
image::icon_availability.png[width=100]

Because {CMK} continuously monitors all hosts and services at regular
intervals, it provides an exceptional basis for the later evaluation of
their availability. And not only that -- it can also be calculated for what
percentage of a given time range an object was in a specified state or states,
how often this state occurred, the duration of its longest stop, and much more.

Every calculation is based on a _selection of objects_ and a specified
_time range in the past_. {CMK} then reconstructs, within this time range,
a chronological sequence of the states of all of the selected objects.
Per state the times will be added together and displayed in a table.
This table can, for example, show that a particular service experienced states
of 99.95% {OK}, and 0.005% {WARN} over the defined time range.

When making such calculations, {CMK} also correctly takes account of such
factors as maintenance times, planned downtimes, unmonitored time ranges and
other special factors, enables the summarisation of states, and the ignoring
of ‘brief interruptions’. Numerous customisation options are also available.
An availablity of link:availability.html#bi[BI-Aggregations] is also possible.



[#states]
=== Possible states

Through the inclusion of scheduled maintenance times and similar special states,
there is in theory a large number of possible combinations of states,
for example: {CRIT} + In Planned Downtime + In Service Time + Flapping.
Because most such combinations are not very useful, {CMK} reduces these to a
small number and in doing so proceeds according to a principle of priorities.
Since in the above example the service was in a scheduled downtime,
the state [.guihint]#in scheduled downtime# simply applies, and the actual state is ignored.
This reduces the list of possible states to the following:

image::avail_states.png[]

This graphic shows the order in which states are prioritised. Later we will show
how some states can be ignored or combined. Here are the states again, in detail:

[cols="30,13,~"]
|===
|State |Abreviation |Description 

|[.guihint]#unmonitored# |N/A |Time ranges during which the object was not being monitored. There are two possible reasons for this: the object was not in the monitoring’s configuration, or the monitoring itself was not running during the specified time range.
|[.guihint]#out of service period# | |The object was outside its service period icon:icon_outof_serviceperiod[] – in other words when its availability was ‘irrelevant’. You can learn more about service periods link:availability.html#serviceperiod[further below].
|[.guihint]#in scheduled downtime# |[.guihint]#Downtime# |The object was in a period of scheduled downtime icon:icon_downtime[] link:basics_downtimes.html[Downtime]. This state will also be assumed for services whose hosts are in a scheduled downtime icon:icon_hostdowntime[].
|[.guihint]#on down host# |[.guihint]#H.Down# |This state is only available for services -- when the service’s host is (down). A monitoring of the service at this time is not possible. For most services this has the same meaning as if the service is {CRIT} -- but not for all! For example, the state of a ([.guihint]#File system#-Check) is certainly independent of the host’s accessibility.
|[.guihint]#flapping# | |Phases in which the state is icon:icon_flapping[] link:monitoring_basics.html#flapping[flapping] -- i.e., those phases during which many changes of state have been experienced over a short time span.
|{UP} {DOWN} {UNREACH} | |Monitoring states for hosts
|{OK} {WARN} {CRIT} {UNKNOWN} | |Monitoring states for services and BI-Aggregates
|===



== Availability retrieval

=== From the view to the analysis

Generating an availability analysis is very simple. First retrieve any
link:views.html[view] of hosts, services or link:bi.html[BI-Aggregates].
The icon:context_button_availability[] button is at the top of the
view -- this button will take you directly to the availability analysis for the
selected object. The data will be displayed as a table:

image::avail_screenshot.png[]

The table shows the same objects that were seen in the preceeding view.
Shown in each column is the proportion of the requested time range an object
was in the state being queried.
The value is given as a percentage, by default to two decimal places -- which
you can also easily link:availability.html#format_time_range[customise].

The time range query can be customised via the icon:avail_button_options[]
symbol in the callable link:availability.html#option_timerange[Time Range] option.
More on this later...

You have the option of receiving the table as a PDF ({CEE} only).
A download of the data in the CSV-Format is also possible [.guihint]#(Export as CSV)#.
It will look like this for the above example:

.Check_MK-Availability-2017-03-14_11-54-16.csv

----

With the help of an link:wato_user.html#automation[Automation user], which can
authenticate itself via the URL, you can also retrieve data -- e.g., with
`wget` or `curl`) -- and automatically process the data under
script control.


[#timeline]
=== Timeline display

[{image-left}]
image::button_timeline.png[width=48]

The icon:button_timeline[] symbol can be found in every line of the table.
This button takes you to a timeline display for the relevant object,
in which it is precisely itemised which state change(s) occurred in
the specified time range (abreviated here):

image::avail_timeline.png[]

Some useful tips:

* Hover the mouse cursor over a timeline symbol in a object’s line in the display, this will be highlighted in the table display.
* In the timeline, with icon:avail_button_options[] you can also customise the link:availability.html#options[options] for the diplays and evaluations.
* With the icon:button_annotation[] symbol you can add an [.guihint]#Annotation# to the selected item. Here you can also retrospectively post downtimes (more on this in the next section).
* Under the availability of BI-Aggregates, with the icon:button_timewarp[] magic wand symbol you can time travel to the state of the aggregate for the time slice in question. More on this link:availability.html#bi[below].
* With the icon:context_button_timeline[] button in the main menu you can view the timelines of all selected objects in a long, single page.


[#annotations]
=== Annotations and subsequent downtimes

As just mentioned, with the icon:button_annotation[] symbol the timelines
offer the possibility of adding an annotation to a time period.
A pre-filled form (‘Properties’) is provided into which comments can be entered:

image::avail_anno_1.png[]

With this you can define and extend the time range with different values
as required. This is, for example, practical if you wish to annotate a
larger time slice that has experienced repeated state changes.
If you omit entering a service, the annotion will be created for the host.
This will then be automatically related to all of the host’s services.

In every availability view all annotations applicable to the time range and
the objects being displayed will be automatically visible.

From Version {v14} the annotations have an additional function.
Downtimes can be retrospectively entered -- or conversely, removed.
The availability analysis takes these corrections into account in exactly
the same way as with ‘normal’ downtimes. There are at least two legitimate
justifications for this:

* During operations it can happen that planned downtimes are incorrectly entered. This of course is bad for the accuracy of the availability statistics. Through retrospective entering of these times the reporting can thus be rectified.
* There are users who misuse downtimes during a spontaneous outage in order to suppress a notification. This effectively corrupts the later analysis. This can be corrected retrospectively by _deleting_ the erroneous downtime.

To reclassify downtimes, simply select the [.guihint]#Reclassify downtime of this period# checkbox:

image::avail_anno_2.png[]


=== Displaying monitoring history

[{image-left}]
image::button_history.png[width=48]

In the availability table, alongside the symbol for the timeline a further
symbol can be found: icon:button_history[]. This takes you to a
link:views.html[view] of the monitoring history with a pre-filled filter for the relevent
object and the time range for the query. Here you will not only see the event
on which the availability analysis is based (the state changes),
but also the associated notifications and similar events:

image::avail_history.jpg[]

What is not visible here is the state of the object at the _start_ of
the query’s time period.
The availability calculation looks even further back into the past in order to
reliably determine the starting state reliably.


[#options]
== Calculation options

[{image-left}]
image::avail_button_options.png[width=48]

As well as the calculation itself, the availability display can also be
controlled using numerous options. These options can be found behind the
icon:avail_button_options[] symbol found at the top left of the page.

Once the options have been altered and confirmed with icon:button_apply[],
the availability will be recalculated and displayed. All of the changed options
will be stored in the user’s profile as the default, so that subsequent queries
will use the same settings.

At the same time the options will be coded into the current page’s URL.
If you now save a _Bookmark_ on the page -- e.g., using the practical
[.guihint]#Bookmarks#-element -- the options will be a part of this, and when later
clicked-on will be generated in exactly the same way.


[#option_timerange]
=== Choosing the time range

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_time_range2.png[width=300]

The first and most important option in any availability calculation is of course
the time range to be examined. In [.guihint]#Date range# a time range with precise start
and end dates can be specified.
The final day -- up until 24:00 -- will be included. +

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_time_range.png[width=300]

Much more practical are the relative time specifications, such as, for example,
[.guihint]#Last week#. Exactly which time range will be
displayed -- intentionally -- depends on the point of time at which the
calculation is made. Note -- here “one week” always refers to a range
from Monday 00:00 until Sunday 24:00.





=== Options affecting displays

Many options influence the format of the displays, while others in turn
influence the calculation methods. To begin with, let’s look at the displays:


==== Hide lines with 100% availability

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_only_outages.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Only show objects with outages# option limits the display to such objects
that really have outages -- i.e., times when the state was not {OK} or {UP}.
This is useful where there are a large number of services, from which only those
few that actually have problems are of interest. +


==== Labelling options

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_labelling.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Labelling options# allow various labelling fields to be activated or
deactivated. Some of the options are primarily interesting for link:reporting.html[Reporting].
If, for instance, a report is to be produced for a single host, then the column
for the Hostname is not really required.

The [.guihint]#alternative display names# for services can be defined using a
WATO link:wato_rules.html[rule], and by using these, for example,
displays for important services can be given a name that is explicit and
meaningful for the report’s reader.


[#thresholds]
==== Using colours when displaying SLAs with thresholds

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_visual_levels.png[width=300]

With [.guihint]#Visual levels# you can highlight objects that have not maintained a
specified availability within the queried time range.
This applies only to the column for the {OK}-state. This is normally always green.
A shortfall for the defined threshold will cause the colour of this cell to change
from green to yellow, or to red.
This could be described as a very simple SLA-overview.


==== Displaying the number and duration of the individual outages

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_outage_statistics.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Outage statistics# option provides additional information columns in
the availability table. In the screenshot below it can be seen that the
additional information for [.guihint]#max. duration# and [.guihint]#count# have been activated
for the [.guihint]#Crit/Down# status column.
This means that for outages with a {CRIT}/{DOWN} state, the number of incidents,
as well as the duration of the longest incident respectively, are shown.

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_count_max.png[width=300]

In the table these additional columns will be created.












[#format_time_range]
==== Time specification display

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_format_time.png[width=300]

It is not always wise to specify (un)availabilities as percentages.
The [.guihint]#Format time ranges# option enables switching to a display that presents
the time ranges as absolute values. With this the total duration of the outages
can be seen to the exact minute. The display even shows seconds, but note that
that this only makes sense if the monitoring is conducted at one-second intervals,
and not as is customary with one check per minute.

Likewise the specification’s precision (the number of decimal places in the
percentage values) can be defined.

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_format_timestamps.png[width=300]


The formatting of time stamps applies to settings in the [.guihint]#Timeline#.
A changeover to UNIX-Epochs (seconds elapsed since 1.1.1970) simplifies the
correlation of time ranges to the appropriate locations in the monitoring
history’s log data.
 +
 +

==== Customising the summary line

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_summary_line.png[width=300]


Not only can the summary in the table's last line be activated/deactivated
with this -- you can also decide between a total sum and an average.
For columns containing a percentage value, using the [.guihint]#Sum# setting will result
in an average being shown, since adding percentage values makes little sense.
 +
 +

==== Showing the small timeline

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_timeline.png[width=300]


This option adds a miniature version of the link:availability.html#timeline[availability timeline]
directly to the results table. It corresponds to the graphic bar in the
detailed timeline, but is smaller and is integrated directly into the table.
In addition, it is true to scale, so that multiple objects can be compared
in the same table.
 +
 +

==== Grouping by host, host group or service group

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_group.png[width=300]


Independently of the display from which you are coming, the availability always
shows all objects in a common table. With this option you can select a grouping
by host, by host group, or by service group -- each group will then
get its own [.guihint]#Summary#-line.


Note that with a grouping by service group, services can appear _multiply_,
since services can be allocated to multiple groups simultaneously.
 +
 +

==== Only display availability

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_availability.png[width=300]


The [.guihint]#Availability# option ensures that only the column for the {OK} or (UP
states will be displayed -- with the title [.guihint]#Avail.#.
In this way only the [.guihint]#actual# availability will shown.
This option can be combined with the further options explained below,
with other states (e.g., {WARN}), and can also include the OK-state and thus
be assessed as available.
 +
 +
 +
 +

=== Grouping of states

The link:availability.html#states[states] described in the introduction can be customised
and condensed in very many ways. In this way very different forms of evaluation
can be flexibly generated. The are various options for this.




==== Handling the WARN, UNKNOWN and Host Down states

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_status_grouping.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Service status grouping# option provides the possibility of showing
various ‘intermediate states’.
A common situation is to force {WARN} to be treated as {OK}.
This can be quite useful if you are interested in a service’s actual
_availability_. Often {WARN} doesn’t mean a real problem exists yet,
but _could_ soon develop.
Thus, looked at in this way, {WARN} must be regarded as available.
With network services such as an HTTP-server, it is certainly sensible to treat
times during which the host is {DOWN} in the same manner as when the service
is {CRIT}.

The states that are omitted due to the regrouping will of course also
be missing from the results table, which will have fewer columns.

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_host_status_grouping.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Host status grouping# option is very similar, but it relates to the
availablity of hosts. The {UNREACH} state means that a host, due to network
problems, cannot be monitored by {CMK}.
In such situations, for the purposes of the availability calculations
you can decide whether you prefer to treat the {UNREACH} state
as {UP} or {DOWN}. The default is to treat {UNREACH} as its own state.
 +
 +

==== Handling of unmonitored time periods and flapping

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_status_classification.png[width=300]

In the [.guihint]#Status classification# option further summarisations will be undertaken.
The [.guihint]#Consider periods of flapping states# check box is on by
default -- with this phases of frequent state changes constitute their own
state: icon:icon_flapping[] -- ‘*flapping*’. The idea behind this is
that even though it can be said that at such times the affected service always
returns to the {OK} state, due to the frequent outages the service is
effectively unuseable.
By deactivating this option the concept of ‘flapping’ will then be completely
ignored, and the respective actual state will reappear -- and the [.guihint]#flapping#
column will also be removed from the table.

Removing the [.guihint]#Consider times where the host is down# option works in a similar
way. The concept of [.guihint]#Host down# is deactivated.
This option only makes sense for the availability of services.
In phases during which the host is not {UP}, the actual state of the service
will be taken as the basis for the availability -- or more precisely, the state
of the last Check before the host became unavailable. This can be sensible with
services for which their accessibility over the network is not relevant.

The [.guihint]#Include unmonitored time# option is also similar.
Assume that an analysis for February is to be made, and that a particular
service has only been in the monitoring since the 15th of February.
Does this service then have an availability of only 50%? With the default
setting -- option _active_ -- this will actually be the case.
The missing 50% will not be assessed as outage, rather it will be added-together
in its own column under the title [.guihint]#N/A#. Without the option it will correspond
to 100% of the time from the 15th to the 28th of February.
This does however mean that a one hour outage for _this_ service will be
reflected as double the percentage of a service that has been monitored for the
whole month.
 +
 +

==== Handling of scheduled downtimes

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_downtimes.png[width=300]


With the [.guihint]#Scheduled Downtimes# option you can specify how
link:basics_downtimes.html[scheduled downtimes] affect the availablity analysis:





* [.guihint]#Honor scheduled downtimes# is the default. Here downtimes will be treated as their own state and summarised in their own column. With [.guihint]#Treat phases of UP/OK as non-downtime# you can subtract the times during which, despite the downtime, the service was {OK}.
* [.guihint]#Ignore scheduled downtimes# is treated as if no downtime had been entered. Outages are outages -- full stop. Of course then only if an outage really occurred.
* [.guihint]#Exclude scheduled downtimes# means that the scheduled downtimes are simply excluded from the time period being analysed. The percentage for the availability then corresponds to the times outside the scheduled downtimes.

==== Merging equal phases

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_phase_merging.png[width=300]

Through the conversion of one state to another (e.g., from {WARN} to {OK}) it
can occur that consecutive sections of an object’s timeline will have the same
state. Normally such sections will be merged into a single section.
This is generally a good thing, and clear, but it does has an effect on the
display of the details in the timeline, and possibly also the counting of events
with the [.guihint]#Outage statistics# option.
You can therefore deactivate this merging with the
[.guihint]#Do not merge consecutive phases with equal state# option.




[#softstates]
=== Ignoring short interruptions

Sometimes monitorings often produce momentary problem messages, but under
normal conditions the object is already {OK} by the time the next check runs
(after one minute) -- and no way has been found through adjusting thresholds or
similar to get a neat grip on such cases.
A common solution is to set the
link:monitoring_basics.html#max_check_attempts[ [.guihint]#Maximum number of check attempts#]
from 1 to 3 to allow more failures before a notification is triggered. Thus the
concept of [.guihint]#Soft states# has been developed -- meaning the {WARN}, {CRIT} or
{UNKNOWN} states -- as long as all of the permitted attempts have not been
‘used up’.

We are occasionally asked by users who use this feature why {CMK}’s Availability
Module has no function for calculating using only [.guihint]#Hard states#.
The reason for this: There is a better solution!
One could use the hard states as the basis...

* ... so that real outages, due to the unsuccessful first and second check attempts, will be assessed as being two minutes too short.
* ... and one could not _retrospectively_ readjust the behaviour for short outages.

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_short_times.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Short time intervals# option is much more flexible and at the same time
very simple. Simply define a length of time which must be exceeded before the
states will be evaluated.

Assume that the time value has been set to 2.5 minutes (150 seconds).
If a service has been continuously {OK}, then is {CRIT} for 2 minutes, and then
reverts to {OK}, the short {CRIT}-interval will simply be assessed as {OK}!
The opposite situation incidently also works! A short {OK} within a long
{WARN}-phase will likewise be assessed as {WARN}.

Generally speaking, short intervals for which _before and after
the same state prevails_ will receive that same state.
For a sequence of {OK}, then a 2 minute {WARN}, followed by {CRIT}, the {WARN}
will persist -- even if it was of a shorter duration than the defined
length of time!

Bear in mind when defining the time, that in {CMK} the standard check interval
is one minute. Thus every state has a duration of multiples of
_approximately_ one minute. Because the agent’s actual response times vary
slightly, this can easily be 61 or 59 seconds.
Therefore it is safer to not enter exact minutes for the value,
rather to include a buffer -- hence the example with 2.5 minutes.


[#serviceperiod]
=== Effect of time periods

An important function of the availability calculations in {CMK} is that they
can be made dependent on link:timeperiods.html[time periods]. With this times
can be defined for every individual host or service.
In these times the host/service will be expected to be available and the state
then used for the calculations. Therefore every object has the
[.guihint]#Service period# attribute. The procedure is as follows:

* Define a time period for the service times.
* Assign these to the objects with the [.guihint]#Host & Service parameters > Monitoring configuration > Service period for hosts# or respectively the [.guihint]#... for services# rule sets.
* Activate the changes.
* Use the [.guihint]#Service time# Availability-option to control the behaviour:

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_service_time.png[width=300]

Here there are three simple possibilities. The default
[.guihint]#Base report only on service times# hides times outside the defined
service times. These hidden times then don't count towards the 100%.
Only the time ranges within the service times will be actually considered.
In the timeline display the remaining times will be ‘greyed-out’.

[.guihint]#Base report only on non-service times# performs the opposite,
and and in effect calculates the inverse display: How good was the availability
_outside_ the service times?

The third option [.guihint]#Include both service and non-service times# deactivates
the complete concept of service times and shows the calculations for
all times from Monday 00:00 to Sunday 24:00.

By the way: If a host is not in the service time, for {CMK} it _does not_
automatically mean that this also applies to the services on the host.
Services always require their own rule in [.guihint]#Service period for services#.





==== The notification periods

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_notification_period.png[width=300]

There is incidentally another related option: [.guihint]#Notification period#.
Here the _notification period_ for the evaluation can also be drawn on.
This was actually only conceived so that for particular times no notifications
for problems would be generated, and does not necessarily cover the service time.
This option was introduced in the past when the software did not yet work with a
service time, and nowadays it has only been retained for compatibility reasons.
It is better not to use it. +
 +

=== Limiting the calculation time

When calculating availability, the complete history of the selected object must
be reopened. How that works in detail can be learned
link:availability.html#technical[further below]. Especially in the {CRE}, the analysis
can take some time, since Nagios has no cache for the required data and the
text-based log data must be sequentially searched.

So that an excessively-complex query -- that may possibly have been started
unintentionally -- does not tie up an Apache process, consume CPU and thus
‘hangs’, there are two options to limit the calculation’s duration.
Both are activated by default:

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_query_time_limit.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Query time limit# limits the duration of the underlying query to the
monitoring core to a specified time. This is predefined as thirty seconds.
If this time is exceeded the analysis will be aborted and an error highlighted.
If you are certain that the analysis can be allowed to run for longer,
simply raise the timeout manually.

[{image-left}]
image::avoption_limit_data.png[width=300]

The [.guihint]#Limit processed data# option protects from calculations with many
objects. Here a limit will be applied that functions analogous to that in the
link:views.html#limit[Views]. If the query to the monitoring core will produce more
than 5000 time periods, the calculation will be aborted with a warning.
The limitation will have been pre-processed in the core -- where the data
is gathered.




[#bi]
== Availability in Business Intelligence

=== The basic principle


A powerful feature of {CMK}’s availability calculation is the facility
to calculate the availability from link:bi.html[BI-Aggregations]. The big attraction
here is that for this purpose {CMK} _retroactively_ reconstructs
the precise state of the respective aggregates at a particular point in time
by using the protocols of the states of the individual hosts and services.

Why so much time and effort? Why not just query the BI-Aggregate with an
active Check, and then show its availability? Well, the effort has quite
a number of advantages for the user:

* The construction of BI-Aggregates can be adapted retrospectively, and then the availability can be recalculated.
* The calculation is more precise, since by not using an active check an inaccuracy of +/- one minute is not generated.
* An excellent analysis function is available, with which the exact cause of an outage can be retrospectively investigated.
* More importantly, an extra check must not be created.


=== Availability retrieval


Retrieving the availability view is initially analogous to that for the hosts
and services. Select a view with one or more BI-Aggregates, and press the
icon:context_button_availability[] button.
Here there is also a second method -- every BI-Aggregate has a direct path
to its availability using the icon:button_availability[] symbol:

image::avail_bi_icon.png[]

In itself the calculation is initially analogous to that for the services,
however without the [.guihint]#Host down# and [.guihint]#flapping# columns, since these states
do not exist for BI:

image::avail_bi_table.png[]


=== Time travel


The big difference is in the icon:button_timeline[] time line view.
The following example shows an aggregate in our demo server, which was {CRIT}
for a very brief interval of one second (this would be a good example for the
use of the [.guihint]#Short time intervals# option).

image::avail_bi_timeline.png[]

Do you want to know what the cause of the outage was? A simple click
icon:button_timewarp[] on the magic wand is enough. This enables a journey
through time to the exact point of time when the outage occurred,
and opens a display of the BI-aggregate  at that time -- in the following image,
already opened at the correct location:

image::avail_bi_timewarp.png[]


== Availability in reports


Availability views can be embedded in link:reporting.html[reports]. The simplest way
is to use the icon:icon_menu[] symbol at the bottom of the window:

image::avail_addto.png[]


The [.guihint]#Availability table# report element inserts an availability analysis into
the report. All of the options discussed above can be found as parameters
directly in the element -- although in a slightly different graphic form:

image::avail_reporting_options.png[]

The final option is a special one:

image::avail_reporting_elements.png[]


Here you can specify which display should be added to the report:


* The availability table
* The graphic display of the timeline
* The timeline in detail with the individual time periods


Unlike the normal interactive views, here you can _simultaneously_ embed
tables and timelines into reports.


A second feature is the specification of the evaluation time period.
This option is missing here, because it is predetermined automatically by the report.


The object selection, as with every report element, is either adopted from the
report or predefined directly in the element.

[#technical]
== Technical background

=== How the calculations function


For calculating the availability, {CMK} accesses the archived monitoring history
logs, and to do so orients itself to the _state changes_.
If, for example, at 9:40 on the 17.3.2017 a service changes its state to {CRIT},
and then at 9:50 changes back to {OK}, then we know that during this 10 minute
time period the service was in a  {CRIT} state.


These state changes are recorded in the Monitoring log, have the alert type
`HOST ALERT` or `SERVICE ALERT`, and look like this for example:

.var/check_mk/core/history
[{file}]
----
[1488890421] SERVICE ALERT: myserver123;Filesystem /var/webshop;CRITICAL;HARD;1;CRIT - 91.9% used (198.40 of 215.81 GB), (warn/crit at 80.00/90.00%), trend: 0.00 B / 24 hours
----


There is always a current log file which includes entries for the most recent
activity up to the present point in time, as well as a directory with an
archive of the preceeding periods.
The location of these files varies, depending on the monitoring core in use:

[cols="20,40,~"]

|Core |Current file |Older files 

|icon:CRE[] Nagios |var/log/nagios.log |var/nagios/archive/
|icon:CEE[] link:cmc.html[CMC] |var/check_mk/core/history |var/check_mk/core/archive
|===



The link:user_interface.html[user interface] does not access these files directly,
rather it queries them using a link:livestatus.html[Livestatus]-query issued from the
monitoring core.
Among other factors, this is important since in a
link:distributed_monitoring.html[distributed monitoring] the history files are not stored
on the same system as the GUI.


The Livestatus query makes use of the `statehist` table. In contrast to
the `log` table – which provides a ‘naked’ access to the history --
here the `statehist` table is used because it has already performed the
initial time-consuming calculation steps. Among other things it assumes the task
of checking back in the history to determine the initial state, and the
calculation of time periods with the same state, with their starts,
durations and ends.


The condensing of the states procedure is performed in the user overview
by the Availability Module, as described at the beginning of this article.


=== The availability cache in CMC

==== How the cache works

{cee-only}
For queries that reach far back into the past, many log
files must be processed accordingly. That obviously has a negative effect on
the duration of the calculation. For this reason, in the {CMK}
Micro Core there is a very efficient cache of the monitoring history,
in which from the start all important information on objects' changes of state
has already been determined from the log files held in RAM, and which is
continuously updated in the active monitoring.
The consequence of this is that *all* availability queries can be
answered directly and very efficiently from the RAM, and thus no further
access is required.

Parsing the log files is very rapid, and with suitably fast hard drives can
achieve a processing speed of up to 80 MB/sec! So that creating the cache does
not delay the start of the monitoring, this is performed asynchronously --
from the present back to the past in fact. A short delay will be noticeable
if _directly following the start_ of the {CMK}-instance an
availability query covering a long time range is initiated immediately.
In such a situation it is possible that the cache does not yet reach far enough
back into the past, and that the GUI needs a few moments to think about it.


With an [.guihint]#Activate changes# the cache is retained! Only with an actual
(re)start of {CMK} will it need to be newly generated -- for example,
following a server reboot or an update of {CMK}.


==== Cache statistics


If you are curious about how long the generation of a cache could take,
a statistic can be found in the `var/log/cmc.log` log file. Here is an
example from a smaller monitoring system:

image::avail_statehist_cache.png[width=550]


==== Tuning the cache


In order to keep the cache’s storage requirement under control, it is limited to
a horizon of up to 730 days into the past. This limit is fixed -- thus queries
reaching further back into the past are not merely slower, they are impossible.
This can be easily customised using the
[.guihint]#Monitoring Core > In-memory cache for availability data# global setting:

image::avail_histcache.png[]

Alongside the horizon for the calculation, additionally there is a second
interesting setting: [.guihint]#Ignore core restarts shorter than...#. A newstart of
the core (e.g., for the purpose of an update or server restart) actually
produces time periods counting as [.guihint]#unmonitored#. Outages of up to 30 seconds
will thereby simply be ignored. This time can be increased and longer times
can also be simply suppressed. The availability calculation will then assume
that all hosts and services have maintained their respective last
communicated states for the whole time.
