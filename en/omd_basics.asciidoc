== OMD - The Open Monitoring Distribution

The {CMK} monitoring system uses the _Open Monitoring Distribution_ (OMD).
Founded by Mathias Kettner, OMD is an Open Source project which revolves around the convenient and flexible installation of a monitoring solution made up of various components.
The abreviation OMD might already be familiar to you as part of the RPM/DEB-Package installation.

An OMD-based installation is distinguished by a number of characteristics:

* the ability to run _multiple_ monitoring sites in parallel
* the ability to operate sites with _differing versions_ of the monitoring software
* an intelligent and convenient mechanism for updating the software - to a higher and lower version,
* an intelligent and easy to operate upgrade/downgrade-mechanism
* uniform file paths -- regardless of which Linux-platform is installed
* a clear separation of _data_ and _software_
* a very simple installation -- with no dependence on third-party software
* a perfect preconfiguration of all components

OMD is managed on the command line, using the `omd` command -- more precisely, a set of `omd` commands for the different actions around the management of the monitoring sites, e.g. `omd create` for creating a site.
The most important `omd` commands are presented in this article.

The first command is `omd help`, which displays an overview of the available `omd` commands.
You can get help for one of these commands by adding the `--help` option after the command, e.g. `omd create --help`.
The two dashes before `help` are important here, because without them `omd create help` would have already created your first site with the name `help`.


[#omd_create]
== Creating sites

Perhaps the best thing about OMD is that it can manage any number of _monitoring sites_ on one server.
Each site is a self-contained monitoring system which runs independently of the others.

A site always has a distinct name, specified at its creation.
This name is the same as that of the Linux user which is created at the same time.
The site's name conforms to the same conventions as user names under Linux.

The creation is performed with the `omd create` command.
This must be executed as `root` user:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd create mysite
Adding /opt/omd/sites/mysite/tmp to /etc/fstab.
Creating temporary filesystem /omd/sites/mysite/tmp...[green]#OK#
Updating core configuration...
Generating configuration for core (type nagios)...
Precompiling host checks...[green]#OK#
Executing post-create script "01_create-sample-config.py"...[green]#OK#
Restarting Apache...[green]#OK#
Created new site mysite with version 2.1.0p1.cre.

  The site can be started with *omd start mysite*.
  The default web UI is available at *http://linux/mysite/*

  The admin user for the web applications is *cmkadmin* with password: *YzxfoFZh*
  For command line administration of the site, log in with *'omd su mysite'*.
  After logging in, you can change the password for cmkadmin with *'htpasswd etc/htpasswd cmkadmin'*.
----

When creating the `cmkadmin` user a password will be randomly-generated and issued.

What takes place during the creation of a site named `mysite`?

* An operating system user `mysite`, and a group `mysite` will be created.
* A new home directory `/omd/sites/mysite` will be created and assigned.
This directory is also called site directory.
* This home directory will be populated with configuration files and sub-directories.
* A basic configuration will be created for the new site.

*Important:* Avoid using a name which is already allocated in another service.
A duplicated allocation can cause problems.


[#user_group_id]
=== User and group IDs

In some cases it is also desirable to specify the user/group ID of the new user to be created.
This is performed with the `-u` and `-g` options, e.g.:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd create -u 6100 -g 180 mysite
----

An overview of the further options can be shown with `omd create --help`.
The most important options are:

[cols="10,~"]
|===
|`-u UID` |The new user will be created with the User-ID `UID`.
|`-g GID` |The new user's group will be created with the Group-ID `GID.
|`--reuse` |OMD assumes that the new user already exists, and does not create it.
|`-t SIZE` |The new site's temporary file system will be created with the `SIZE` value. `SIZE` has the suffix `M` (Megabyte), `G` (Gigabyte) or `%` (percentage of RAM). Example: `-t 4G`
|===


[#site_user]
== Site user

You can execute the `omd` commands as `root` user or as _site user_.
Under `root` you have more possibilities.
For example, only `root` can create a site, which is understandable because the site user is not created until the site is created.
Since you can run commands on `root` for all existing sites, you must include the name of the site you are concerned with in the `omd` command.

Once the site exists, you should run the other `omd` commands only as site user.
As a site user you can execute all important operations affecting this site.

Switching users is done with `su`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} su - mysite
----

Note that the minus sign following the `su` is essential.
It ensures that switching users processes _all_ of the operations that take place during a normal login.
In particular, all environment variables will be correctly set, and your session will start as `mysite` in the `/omd/sites/mysite` site directory.

Alternatively, you can use

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd su mysite
----

which will also open a login shell:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd}
----

As a site user, you usually don't need to include a site name with `omd` commands, since such a command is applied to the site you are logged in as.

*Note:* 
If you have multiple {CMK} versions installed on your {CMK} server, the corresponding OMD version will be installed with each of these versions.
This can result in a long list of software versions over time.
Since `omd` commands can also differ between versions, it is sometimes interesting to know which OMD version you are currently working with.
As a site user, you always use the `omd` commands of the {CMK} version currently installed on the site.
As a `root` user, you run the commands of the default version that is also used when creating a site.
You can display the default version with `omd version` and change it with `omd setversion` -- but the latter again only as `root` user.


[#omd_start_stop]
== Starting and stopping sites

Your site is now ready to be started -- which can be done as `root` with `omd start mysite`.
It is fundamentally better though to work with the site as the site user:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd start
Creating temporary filesystem /omd/sites/mysite/tmp...[green]#OK#
Starting agent-receiver...OK
Starting mkeventd...OK
Starting rrdcached...OK
Starting npcd...OK
Starting nagios...OK
Starting apache...OK
Starting redis...OK
Initializing Crontab...OK
----

Unsurprisingly, stopping goes with `omd stop`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd stop
Removing Crontab...OK
Stopping redis...killing 484382...OK
Stopping apache...killing 484371...OK
Stopping nagios...OK
Stopping npcd...OK
Stopping rrdcached...waiting for termination...OK
Stopping mkeventd...killing 484279...OK
Stopping agent-receiver...killing 484267...OK
Stopping 1 remaining site processes...[green]#OK#
----

Starting and stopping a site is nothing other than starting or stopping a collection of services.
These can also be individually managed by specifying the name of the service, e.g.:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd start apache
Temporary filesystem already mounted
Starting apache...OK
----

The names of the various services can be found in the `~/etc/init.d` directory.
Note the tilde at the beginning of the path name
-- this represents the home directory for the site user (the site directory).
`~/etc/init.d` and `/etc/init.d` are different directories.

Alongside `start` and `stop`, there are also the `omd` commands `restart`, `reload` and `status`.
Reloading Apache is, for example, always necessary following a manual change to the Apache configuration:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd reload apache
Reloading apache
----

Note that this does not apply to the global Linux server's Apache process, but rather the site's own dedicated Apache process.

In order to be able to maintain an overview of state of the site following all of the starts and stops, simply use `omd status`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd status
agent-receiver: [red]#stopped#
mkeventd:       [red]#stopped#
rrdcached:      [red]#stopped#
npcd:           [red]#stopped#
nagios:         [red]#stopped#
apache:         [green]#running#
redis:          [red]#stopped#
crontab:        [red]#stopped#
-----------------------
Overall state:  [yellow]#partially running#
----


[#omd_config]
== Configuring the components

As already mentioned, OMD integrates multiple software components into a monitoring system.
In so doing, some components are optional, and for some there are alternatives or different operational settings.
All of this can be comfortably configured with `omd config` command.
There are also interactive and scripting modes.


[#interactive_mode]
=== Interactive configuration

You call the interactive mode as site user simply like this: 

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd config
----

.In the `omd config` menu you navigate with the cursor and enter keys
image::omd_basics_omd_config_main.png[alt="Main menu of `omd config`.",width=300]

As soon as you change a setting while the site is running, OMD will inform you that your site must be stopped first and does this as needed:

.The configuration can only be changed if the site is not running
image::omd_basics_omd_config_cannotchange.png[alt="Hint when changing a setting while the site is running.",width=300]

Don't forget to restart the site following the completion of the work.
`omd config` will _not_ do this for you automatically.


[#script_mode]
=== Configuration via script mode

Those who don't like the interactive mode, or prefer to work with scripts, can set the individual settings as variables via command line.
For this there is the `omd config set` command.
The following example sets the `AUTOSTART` variable to `off`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd config set AUTOSTART off
----

This can be also performed as `root` if the site's name is added as an argument:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd config mysite set AUTOSTART off
----

The current assignment of all variables can be viewed using `omd config show`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd config show
ADMIN_MAIL: 
AGENT_RECEIVER: on
AGENT_RECEIVER_PORT: 8005
APACHE_MODE: own
APACHE_TCP_ADDR: 127.0.0.1
APACHE_TCP_PORT: 5008
AUTOSTART: off
[...]
----

The command output above shows only the first entries.


=== Commonly used settings

There are numerous settings in `omd config`.
The most important are:

[cols="15,15,~",options="header"]
|===
|Variable |Default |Meaning 
|`AUTOSTART` |`on` |Set this to `off` if you want to prevent an automatic starting of the site when the computer is started. This is primarily of interest for test installations that should not normally start by themselves.
|`CORE` |`nagios` ({RE}), `cmc` ({EE}) |Selection of the monitoring core. In the {CEE} there is the xref:cmc#[{CMK} Micro Core (CMC)] and the classic Nagios core. In the {CRE} there is only `nagios` as monitoring core.
|`MKEVENTD` |`on` |Activates the xref:glossar#ec[Event Console] with which the syslog messages, SNMP traps and other events can be processed.
|`LIVESTATUS_TCP` |`off` |Allows external access to the status data for this site. This can be used to set up a xref:glossary#distributed_monitoring[distributed monitoring]. The status of this (remote) site can be incorporated into the central site. Enable this setting only in a secured network.
|===

*Note:* You can also see these variables under the same name in interactive mode.


[#omd_cp_mv]
== Copying and renaming sites

[#omd_cp]
=== Copying sites

It is sometimes useful to create a copy of a site, for testing purposes or for the preparation of an xref:update#[update].
Of course one could simply copy the `/omd/sites/mysite_old` directory to `/omd/sites/mysite_new`.
That will however not work as desired, because:

* many configuration files include the site's name,
* also in several places absolute paths appear which start with `/omd/sites/mysite_old`,
* and not least, there must be an xref:user_group_id[user including associated group] at operating system level that owns the site and is named by default as the site.

To simplify copying a site, there is instead the `omd cp` command, which takes all this into account.
Run the command as `root` and simply enter the name of the existing site followed by the name of the new one.
For example:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd cp mysite_old mysite_new
----

The copy can only work if:

* the site is stopped and
* no processes are running that belong to the site user.

Both of these ensure that the site is in a consistent state at the time of copying and does not change during the operation.


[#omd_cp_mv_migration]
=== Migrating the configuration

OMD could originally only handle the files that were actually created during xref:omd_create[creation of the site] with `omd create`, and which also contained the site ID (`$OMD_SITE`).
These files can be found in the site directory `~/etc` with this command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} grep -r $OMD_SITE etc
----

Previously, OMD could not do anything with configuration files that were created later via work with the {CMK} site (the configurations of hosts that had been added at a later date, for example).
From a purely technical point of view, this behavior corresponds exactly to the scope of OMD.
However, the expectation of most users is that an `omd cp` creates a completely new site that can continue to be used productively -- including its own monitoring configuration.

From {CMK} version {v21} OMD can now also customize the most important elements of the {CMK} configuration.
By the way, you don't have to do anything, the whole migration described below takes place automatically.

A typical example:
In a host's properties you can use the [.guihint]#Monitored on site# attribute to manually specify which site this host should be monitored on, for example `mysite_old`.
After an `omd cp mysite_old mysite_new` the value will change to `mysite_new` accordingly.
(Previously this procedure would have resulted in the entry `Unknown site (mysite_old)`).

The actual technical implementation of this migration is as follows:
OMD detects changes to the site ID and then executes the `post-rename-site -v -o mysite_new` command.
The individual migration steps are subsequently processed completely automatically via the so-called _rename actions plugins_, which you can find in the Git repository at link:https://github.com/tribe29/checkmk/tree/master/cmk/post_rename_site/plugins/actions[cmk/post_rename_site/plugins/actions^].

Migration also includes informing you about anything that *cannot* be migrated automatically.

Here's a concrete example:
you are using distributed monitoring and rename both the central site and a remote site.

*Central site:* The `sites.py` plug-in detects that this is a central site and updates, among other things, the [.guihint]#URL prefix# value, which can be found in the connection settings of the local site under [.guihint]#Setup > General > Distributed Monitoring#.

*Remote site:* The `warn_remote_site.py` plug-in recognizes that it is a remote site and accordingly indicates that the central site must be checked and manually adapted if necessary.
This in turn means that in the distributed monitoring settings on the central site, the remote site's new name must be entered in the connection settings to the renamed remote  site -- OMD of course cannot do this from a remote computer.

OMD itself informs you in detail about the whole procedure in the terminal.
Here you can see an example of the migration messages of the `omd cp` output when renaming a central site -- separated into success and warning messages.
The processed `rename action plugins` are numbered individually.
First the output from the automatically performed migration tasks (shortened here):

[{shell}]
----
...
Executing post-cp script "01_cmk-post-rename-site"...
-|  1/6 Distributed monitoring configuration...
-|  2/6 Hosts and folders...
-|  3/6 Update core config...
...
----

The second part of the output now contains tips regarding settings you *may* need to configure manually (here heavily abbreviated):

[{shell}]
----
...
-|  4/6 Warn about renamed remote site...
-|  5/6 Warn about new network ports...
-|  6/6 Warn about configurations to review...
...
----

The `Warn about configurations to review...` item includes general notes on individual aspects that will generally need to be reviewed manually during a migration, such as hardcoded filters for views:

[{shell}]
----
...
-| Parts of the site configuration cannot be migrated automatically. The following
-| parts of the configuration may have to be reviewed and adjusted manually:
-|
-| - Custom bookmarks (in users bookmark lists)
-| - Hard coded site filters in custom dashboards, views, reports
-| - Path in rrdcached journal files
-| - NagVis maps or custom NagVis backend settings
-| - Notification rule "site" conditions
-| - Event Console rule "site" conditions
-| - "site" field in "Agent updater (Linux, Windows, Solaris)" rules (CEE/CME only)
-| - Alert handler rule "site" conditions (CEE/CME only)
-|
-| Done
----

Here is an overview of the six currently active plug-ins -- the order here corresponds to the numbering in the above output:

[cols="35,~",options="header"]
|===
|Plug-in |Function
|`sites.py` |Changes the site ID in various configuration files.
|`hosts_and_folders.py` |Changes the site attribute of host and folder properties.
|`update_core_config.py` |Updates the core configuration (`cmk -U`).
|`warn_remote_site.py` |Warns when renaming a remote site.
|`warn_changed_ports.py` |Notices of problems with multiple ports.
|`warn_about_not_migrated_configs.py` |General tips for elements that should be checked manually.
|===


[#limit_data]
=== Limiting data volume

If you are monitoring a large number of hosts with the site, the volume of data to be copied can be quite substantial.
Most of this is caused by the measured values stored in the xref:graphing#rrds[Round Robin Databases (RRD)].
But the log files containing historic events can also produce larger data volumes. 

If the history is not required (for example, because you just want to test something quickly), these can be omitted from the copy.
In such cases the following options can be added to `omd cp`:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|`--no-rrds` |Copies the site without the RRDs.
|`--no-logs` |Copies the site without log files and other historical data.
|`-N` |Does both: `-N` is an abbreviation for `--no-rrds --nologs`.
|===

The order of the option(s) is important:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd cp --no-rrds mysite_old mysite_new
----


[#omd_mv]
=== Renaming sites

Renaming a site is performed with the `omd mv` command.
This is done similarly to xref:omd_cp[copying a site], has the same prerequisites and is also done including xref:omd_cp_mv_migration[configuration migration].
The options to restrict the data volume are not available since the data is only being moved to another directory and is not being duplicated.c
Example:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd mv mysite_old mysite_new
----


=== Other options

As with creating a site, copying and renaming each create a new Linux user.
Therefore `omd cp` and `omd mv` also have some of the options of `omd create`, e.g. to specify xref:user_group_id[user and group IDs].
For more detailed information, use the `omd cp --help` and `omd mv --help` commands.


[#omd_diff]
== Showing changes in configuration files

When xref:omd_create[creating a site], the `omd create` command fills the `~/etc` directory with numerous predefined configuration files.
A number of directories will also be created under `~/var` and `~/local`.

Now it is probably the case that in the course of time a number of the files will have been customized.
When after a time you wish to determine which files are no longer in the condition as originally supplied, the `omd diff` command can provide the answer.
Amongst other things, this is useful before an xref:update#[update of {CMK}], since your changes could conflict with changes in the default files.

When called without further arguments, all changed files below the current directory will be listed:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd diff
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content var/check_mk/wato/auth/auth.php
 [yellow]#!# Changed permissions var/check_mk/wato/auth/auth.php
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content etc/htpasswd
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content etc/diskspace.conf
 [yellow]#!# Changed permissions etc/diskspace.conf
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content etc/auth.secret
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content etc/mk-livestatus/xinetd.conf
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content etc/omd/allocated_ports
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content etc/apache/apache.conf
 [green]#pass:[*]# Deleted etc/apache/apache-own.conf
----

You can also enter a query for a specific directory:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd diff etc/apache
 [green]#pass:[*]# Changed content etc/apache/apache.conf
 [green]#pass:[*]# Deleted etc/apache/apache-own.conf
----

If you wish to see the changes in detail, simply enter the path to the file:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd diff etc/apache/apache.conf
74,75c74,75
< ServerLimit 64
< MaxClients 64
---
> ServerLimit 128
> MaxClients 128
----


[#omd_update]
== Updating sites

To update the monitoring software installed on the site to a higher (but also to a lower) version, the command `omd update` is used.
This is presented in detail in the article on the xref:#detailed[update of {CMK}].
Other useful `omd` commands related to software updates are also shown there as examples:

* `omd versions` to list all installed software versions,
* `omd sites` to list all existing sites with the versions installed on them,
* `omd version` to display the default version used when creating a site, 
* `omd setversion` to set a different default version.

By the way, `omd update` is also used to xref:update#updatedemo[upgrade] to another edition, e.g. from the {FE} to the {SE}.


[#omd_backup_restore]
== Backing up and restoring sites

=== Creating a backup

The site management in {CMK} has a built-in mechanism for backing up and restoring {CMK} sites.
The `omd backup` and `omd restore` commands are the basics for packing all of the site's data into a tar archive, and respectively, extracting that data for a restore.

*Note:* {CMK} also offers the possibility to perform backup and restore without command line via the GUI under [.guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > Backups#.
There you can also create encrypted backups and scheduled backup jobs. 
See the xref:backup#[Backups] article to learn how to do this.

Backing up a site with `omd backup` does not require `root` permissions.
A site user can perform this.
Simply enter as an argument the name of the backup file to be created:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd backup /tmp/mysite.tar.gz
----

Note that:

* The created file type is a gzip-compressed tar archive. Therefore use `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` as file extension.
* Do *not* store the backup in the site directory, since this will of course be completely backed up – thus every subsequent backup will contain a copy of _all_ of its predecessors.

If the backup's target directory is not writable for a site user, you can also do the backup as `root`.
In this case an additional argument is required, as always, specifying the site name to be backed up:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd backup mysite /var/backups/mysite.tar.gz
----

The backup contains all of the site's data -- except for the volatile data under `~/tmp/`.
With the `tar tzf` command one can easily have a look at the file's contents:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} tar tvzf /tmp/mysite.tar.gz  | less
lrwxrwxrwx mysite/mysite     0 2022-07-25 11:59 mysite/version -> ../../versions/2.1.0p8.cre

-rw-r--r-- mysite/mysite  1524 2022-06-26 02:03 mysite/.version_meta/skel/etc/apache/apache-own.conf
----


=== Backup without history

The lion's share of the data to be moved during a site backup are the measured values and the log files with historical events.
This is just as true when backing up as when copying a site.
If you do not absolutely need this data, you can omit it and thus make the backup much faster and the result file much smaller.

`omd backup` offers xref:limit_data [the same options] to omit this data as `omd cp` does when copying.
In the following example, the backup is created without measurement data and without the history stored in the log files:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd backup -N /tmp/mysite.tar.gz
----


=== Backing up a running site

A backup can also be created from a running site.
To ensure to ensure a consistent state of the xref:graphing#rrds[Round Robin Databases (RRD)] used for recording the measurement data, the `omd backup` command automatically alters the Round Robin cache to a mode with which the running updates are written only to the journal, and no longer to the RRDs.
The journal files are the last to be backed up -- thus it can be achieved that as much as possible of the measurement data that has been generated during the backup is also included in the backup.


=== Restore

Restoring a backup is as simple as the backup itself.
The `omd restore` command restores a site from a backup.
This is even possible as a site user.
The site is completely emptied and refilled.
Before `omd restore` the site must be stopped and afterwards it must be restarted:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd stop
{c-omd} omd restore /tmp/mysite.tar.gz
{c-omd} omd start
----

A restore can also be performed by a`root` user.
Unlike when called by the site user, the site  will be _recreated_ with the backup.

So if there is still a site with the same name, you have to xref:omd_rm[delete] it before.
This can be performed either with an `omd rm`, or by simply including the `--reuse` option with the `omd restore`.
A `--kill` additionally ensures that the still existing site is stopped before.
You do not need to specify the site name in the command, because it is contained in the backup:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd restore --reuse --kill /var/backup/mysite.tar.gz
{c-root} omd start mysite
----

As `root`, you can also restore a site with a different name from that in the backup.
To do this, specify the desired name as an argument after the word `restore`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd restore mysite2 /var/backup/mysite.tar.gz
Restoring site mysite2 from /tmp/mysite.tar.gz...
 [green]#pass:[*]# Converted ./.modulebuildrc
 [green]#pass:[*]# Converted ./.profile
 [green]#pass:[*]# Converted etc/xinetd.conf
 [green]#pass:[*]# Converted etc/logrotate.conf
----

The long list of conversions that happen here has the same function as for xref:omd_cp_mv [copying and renaming sites] described earlier.
The site name is included in numerous configuration files, and with this these occurrences will be replaced automatically by the new name.


[#ssh_omd_backup_restore]
=== Live backup & restore to another server

The `omd backup` and `omd restore` commands can -- in good old Unix tradition -- also work via standard input/output instead of files.
Instead of a path for the tar file, simply enter a hyphen (`-`).

In this way a pipe can be constructed and the data ‘streamed’ directly to another computer without requiring intermediate files.
The larger the backup, the more advantageous this will be since no temporary space in the backed up server's file system will be needed.

The following command backs up a site to another computer using SSH:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd backup mysite - | ssh user@otherserver "cat > /var/backup/mysite.tar.gz"
----

If you want to reverse the SSH access, i.e. prefer to connect from the backup server to the {CMK} site, this is also possible, as the following example shows.
For this, first an SSH login as a site user must be permitted.

[{shell}]
----
root@otherserver# ssh mysite@checkmkserver "omd backup -" > /var/backup/mysite.tar.gz
----

If you are clever, and combine the above with an `omd restore` which reads the data from the standard input, you can copy a complete, running site from one server to another -- and without needing any
additional space for a backup file:

[{shell}]
----
root@otherserver# ssh mysite@checkmkserver "omd backup -" | omd restore -
----

And now again the whole thing with reversed SSH access -- this time again from the source system to the target system:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd backup mysite - | ssh user@otherserver "omd restore -"
----


[#omd_rm]
== Deleting sites

Deleting a site is as easy as xref:omd_create[creating] one -- with the `omd rm` command as `root`.
The site will first be automatically stopped.

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd rm mysite
PLEASE NOTE: This action removes all configuration files
             and variable data of the site.

In detail the following steps will be done:
- Stop all processes of the site
- Unmount tmpfs of the site
- Remove tmpfs of the site from fstab
- Remove the system user <SITENAME>
- Remove the system group <SITENAME>
- Remove the site home directory
- Restart the system wide apache daemon
 (yes/NO): *yes*
----

It goes without saying that this action also *deletes all of the site's data!*

If you are no fan of confirmation prompts, or wish to perform the deletion as part of a script, the deletion can be forced with the `-f` option.
*Attention:* Here the `-f` must be placed *before* the `rm`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd -f rm mysite
----
