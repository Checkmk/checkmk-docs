[#intro]
== Introduction

The _password store_ in {CMK} enables passwords that are required for accessing a wide variety of systems in the monitoring system to be stored in a central location.
The password store differentiates between who is allowed to store a password and who is allowed to use it.
This allows you to map an organizational separation in your company between the storage and use of access data in {CMK}.
For this purpose, {CMK} provides the xref:wato_user#contact_groups[contact groups].

A further advantage is that a password saved in the password store can be changed without having to touch the actual configuration that uses this password.
The password itself is not displayed during use, only its title.

The password store not only stores the passwords assigned to a user, but also, for example, _secrets_ (for apps in xref:monitoring_azure#[Microsoft Azure]), _tokens_ (for service accounts in a xref:monitoring_kubernetes#[Kubernetes] cluster) or _URLs_ (for notifications to xref:notifications_teams#[Microsoft Teams], xref:notifications_slack#[Slack] or xref:notifications_webex#[Cisco Webex Teams], for example).

[TIP]
====
The password store is used to collect sensitive information in a central location instead of keeping it distributed in different places in the {CMK} xref:glossar#site[site].
The password store is *not* a password safe.
{CMK} requires the access data with the passwords in plain text in order to be able to continuously contact the remote systems and retrieve the monitoring data.
So that the passwords are not stored in plain text in the file system, the password file is encrypted -- using a key that is also stored in the site directory.
To make it clear that this encryption is not what is generally understood to be, this procedure is called *obfuscation*.
====

The use of the password store is always offered in {CMK} for when it is necessary to enter access data in order to have access to another system's monitoring data,
for example, when configuring xref:glossar#active_check[active checks,] xref:glossar#special_agent[special agents,] rules for the xref:glossar#agent_bakery[Agent Bakery] or notification methods in xref:notifications.html#rules[notification rules].

In this article, we will explain how to use the password store using the example of accessing an MQTT server -- or _broker,_ as it is called in the link:https://mqtt.org/[MQTT^] architecture.
Such a broker collects sensor data in the 'Internet of Things' (IoT).
In {CMK}, this broker can be monitored, for example to determine how many messages are in the queue.


[#pwd_create]
== Creating a password

You can access the {CMK} password store via [.guihint]#Setup > General > Passwords#.
To create a new password, click on [.guihint]#Add password.#

.A password for an MQTT broker is created here
image::password_store_add_password.png[alt="Dialog for creating a password in the password store."]

As usual in Checkmk, the creation of a password in the password store also requires an internal [.guihint]#Unique ID# and a [.guihint]#Title#.
Choose a meaningful title so that later not only you know what it is about, but also those {CMK} users who will use the password
-- because only this title will be displayed when xref:pwd_select[selecting a password].

First enter the password in the [.guihint]#Password properties# box.
With the following two options, [.guihint]#Editable by# and [.guihint]#Share with#, you control who has access to this password.

With [.guihint]#Editable by# you select a group of {CMK} users who have full access to the password -- to use, change or delete it.
The default selection here is [.guihint]#Administrators# and restricts access to {CMK} administrators, as only the `admin` role has the [.guihint]#Write access to all passwords# permission by default.
However, you can also grant full access to a contact group that has already been assigned to you.
With the [.guihint]#Share with# option, you can add contact groups to which the password should be made available _in addition to use_.

Once you have completed the password creation with [.guihint]#Save#, you will see the overview page for the password store, which lists all passwords with the most important parameters:

.The password list is preceded by what the password store can -- and cannot -- do
image::password_store_password_store.png[alt="The password store overview page."]

[TIP]
====
By default, access to the password store is open not only for administrators, but also for normal monitoring users,
as the two roles `admin` and `user` have the [.guihint]#Password management# authorization.
However, normal monitoring users only see the passwords for which they have full access and they can only assign a password to contact groups (and not to {CMK} administrators).
====


[#pwd_select]
== Selecting a password

You can select a password from the password store within many {CMK} pages.
For example, you can find the active checks in [.guihint]#Setup > Services > HTTP, TCP, Email, ...# and the special agents in [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > VM, Cloud, Container# or [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Other integrations.#

The rule set for the MQTT special agent is called [.guihint]#MQTT broker statistics.#
Create a new rule:

.The password for the MQTT broker is used here
image::password_store_select_password.png[alt="Rule with which a password can be selected from the password store"]

Activate [.guihint]#Username# and enter the MQTT broker's user name.
Then activate [.guihint]#Password of the user.#
By default, [.guihint]#Explicit# is selected to enter the password directly in the corresponding field.
Whenever you are offered a list when entering access data, you can also use the password store instead of explicit entry.
To do this, select [.guihint]#From password store# in the list.
A list containing all the passwords you can use will then be displayed on the right.
