:title: Backups - Backing up and restoring data
:description: In this article you will learn how to back up the data of a {CMK} site and restore it.

{related-end}


== Basics

Over time, you will put quite a bit of work into the exact configuration of your hosts and services, limits, notifications and so on -- so you should make backups.
This is not only useful in case something goes wrong, but also for testing or using different configurations. 
You can back up the complete configuration and _restore_ it if necessary. 
Backups can be scheduled, encrypted and compressed.

You can access the creation of backups in [.guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > Backups#.


== Prerequisites

In order to create backups on the source system and later restore them on the target system, there are two main requirements:

* The exact same xref:cmk_versions#[{CMK} version] must be installed on both systems, e.g. `2.1.0p1`.
* Both systems must have the same {CMK} edition installed, e.g. the {CRE}.

Note: The system platform is not relevant, so you can, for example, backup with Ubuntu as the source system and restore with Redhat or an appliance as the target system.


== Voraussetzungen

Um Backups auf dem Quellsystem zu erstellen und später auch wieder auf dem Zielsystem zurückspielen zu können, gibt es zwei wesentliche Voraussetzungen:

* Auf beiden Systemen muss die exakt gleiche xref:cmk_versions#[Checkmk-Version] installiert sein, also z.B. `2.1.0p1`.
* Auf beiden Systemen muss die gleiche Checkmk-Edition installiert sein, z.B. die {CRE}.

Hinweis: Die Systemplattform ist nicht relevant, so dass Sie zum Beispiel ein Backup mit Ubuntu als Quellsystem erstellen und mit Redhat oder einer Appliance als Zielsystem zurückspielen können.



[#backup_config]
== Configuring encrypted backups

In the first step, switch to the list of backup targets on the [.guihint]#Site backup# page with the [.guihint]#Backup targets# action button and create a new target with [.guihint]#Add target#:

image::backup_target_config.png[alt="Dialogue for defining a backup target."]

The absolute path specification under [.guihint]#Destination# refers to the system, not the site.

Once you have saved the backup target, go back to the [.guihint]#Site backup# page. 
Open the list of backup keys with [.guihint]#Backup encryption keys# and create a new key for your backups with [.guihint]#Add key# with a meaningful name and a secure password (_passphrase_):

image::backup_key_config.png[alt="Dialogue for specifying a backup key."]

After creating the key, you will see a message telling you that you have not downloaded the keys yet:

image::backup_key_warning.png[alt="Message telling that the backup keys have not yet been downloaded."]

You can download the key in PEM format using the [.guihint]#Download this key# button.
By the way, you also have to enter the passphrase of the key when downloading.
Since you need these keys to restore backups, the message will remain until all keys have been saved.

image::backup_keys_for_backups.png[alt="List of backup keys."]

*Note:* If a backup key should ever no longer be available, you can upload the backed-up key again. You must also enter the passphrase before uploading.


[#backup_job_create]
== Creating a backup job

Now you can create a new backup job -- again on the [.guihint]#Site backup# page, this time using the [.guihint]#Add job# button:

image::backup_job_config.png[alt="Dialogue for defining a backup job."]

Here you can select, among other things, the items you just created under [.guihint]#Target# and [.guihint]#Encryption#.
You will also find options for compression and scheduling backups.
As you will soon see, you can also trigger backups manually.
With [.guihint]#Do not backup historical data# you can save metrics (RRD files), monitoring history and log files, which results in significantly smaller backup archives.


[#backup_create]
== Creating a backup

On the [.guihint]#Site backup# page you can now see your finished backup job and can start it via icon:icon_backup_start[alt="Icon for starting the backup."]:

image::backup_job_play.png[alt="List entry of a backup job not yet started."]

You can stop running backups with icon:icon_backup_stop[alt="Icon for stopping the backup."]:

image::backup_job_running.png[alt="List entry of a running backup job."]

Finally, you will see a confirmation that the backup has completed:

image::backup_job_finished.png[alt="List entry of a completed backup job."]

For both running and completed jobs, icon:icon_backup_state[alt="Icon for displaying the details of the backup job."] takes you to the details for the job.


[#backup_restore]
== Restoring a backup

You can start restoring backups on the [.guihint]#Site backup# page by clicking on [.guihint]#Restore#. The procedure is largely self-explanatory:

. Select the backup target with icon:icon_backup_restore[alt="Icon for restoring the backup."].
. Select the desired backup to be restored with icon:icon_backup_restore[alt="Icon for restoring the backup."].
. Enter the passphrase for the backup key.
. Start the restore.

After restoring, the site will be restarted, so you temporarily see an HTTP 503 error message:

image::backup_restore_warning.png[alt="HTTP 503 error message."]

As soon as the site is available again, you will get the details on the result:

image::backup_restore_finished.png[alt="Dialogue with the details of the restore."]

Finally, confirm the restore by clicking [.guihint]#Complete the restore#.
