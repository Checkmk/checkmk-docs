== Introduction

When setting up the monitoring, certainly the most important task is the administration of the systems to be monitored -- the _hosts_.
It’s not just about registering the correct master data (e.g., host name, IP address) -- settings for the monitoring (e.g., alarms, thresholds, etc.) also need to be attended to.

{CMK} has been developed from its beginning for environments with a large number of hosts.
In order for the configuration to be manageable for the user, {CMK} pursues a different approach to configuration than other systems that originated from the Nagios ecosystem.
The most important principles are:

* a folder hierarchy in which the hosts are stored
* Host tags, and based on these, a xref:wato_rules#[rule based] configuration
* xref:wato_services#[Automatic discovery] of the services to be monitored


[#folder]
=== Folders and their hierarchies

Everyone who works with computers knows the principles of data sets and folders.
{CMK} uses a similar principle for administering hosts, which in effect take on the role of data sets.
Insofar as folders themselves can be in folders, the result is a ‘tree structure’.
There are three widely-used criteria for building the host-tree:

* *Location* (e.g. Munich versus Shanghai)
* *Host type* (e.g. Switch versus Loadbalancer)
* *Organisation structure* (e.g. Database group versus Networker)

Naturally you can also mix these criteria in a tree with, for example, subdivision by location in the first level, and by host type in the second.

If you love simple things you should pack the actual hosts only in the tree’s ‘leaves’ (although {CMK} also allows hosts in intermediate folders).
The following example shows a simple tree structured by host type:
The hosts A, B and C are in the folder ‘Servers‘ and D, E and F in 'Network' :

image::wato_folders_step_2.png[alt="Illustration of a folder structure with two subfolders.",width=430px]


[#inheritance]
=== Attribute inheritance

If you build the tree cleverly you can use it to pass on attributes in a meaningful manner.
This is especially useful with attributes that are the same for large groups of hosts, e.g., the SNMP community, or _host tags_, with which you define whether the host should be monitored via a {CMK} agent or per SNMP.

The following example shows the passing-on of the 'Criticality' attribute (with the `prod` and `test` values), likewise the '{CMK} agent' attribute
with the `tcp` and `no-agent` values. The `tcp` feature is automatically set if the {CMK} agent and/or an API integration is selected, while `no-agent` is the option of choice if monitoring is to be done via SNMP.

image::wato_folders_step_4.png[alt="Illustration of a folder structure with assigned attributes on different levels.",width=500px]

Attributes defined lower in the tree always have precedence.
Values defined directly at the host therefore overwrite everything that comes from the folders.
In the above example, the host A receives the `prod` and `tcp` attributes, host D receives `prod` and `no-agent`, and host F -- because of the explicit attribute `test` at the host -- receives the `test` and `no-agent` values.

A big advantage of this procedure over the the widely-used 'copy & paste' approach of data base oriented configuration systems is that you can predefine attributes for hosts that will be registered *in the future*.
This makes your (or your colleagues’) work easier -- simply throw the new host into the correct folder and all settings will automatically be correct!


=== Permissions

A further function of the folder is the assignment of permissions for creating and editing hosts.
{CMK} here differentiates between rights in the configuration environment and the contact allocation in the monitoring environment.
It’s not always the case that the persons authorised to create a host are the same people who are responsible for the host’s operational monitoring.
The permissions are explained in the article on xref:wato_user#wato_permissions[users, roles and permissions].

You create new folders via icon:icon_newfolder[alt="Icon for creating a folder."] [.guihint]#Add folder#.
The options are the same as when creating new hosts, which we will explain in detail below.


[#create_hosts]
== Creating hosts in Setup

You can manage folders and hosts via [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts:#

image::hosts_main_directory.png[alt="View of 'Main directory' with multiple subfolders."]

The [.guihint]#Add host# action button, the icon:icon_clone[alt="Icon for cloning a list entry."] clone button and the icon:icon_edit[alt="Icon for editing a list entry."] edit host button take you to the page with the host’s attributes. This consists of several sections (or boxes), of which we will introduce the most important.


=== The host name

Most important is the host name.
Everywhere in {CMK} the [.guihint]#Hostname# field serves to explicitly identify the host.
The host name is entered in internal references, used as a component of the URL, serves as a part of file names and directories, and appears in log files, etc.
There is in fact a function for changing host names at a later date -- this is however a time-consuming and complex procedure that is best avoided.
You should therefore select host names carefully.
The host’s name does not necessarily need to match the host’s DNS name, but it makes many things easier.

image::hosts_new_host_1.png[alt="Dialogue with host properties: the host name."]


[#dns]
=== Alias and IP address

You can give the host an alternative, descriptive name under [.guihint]#Alias# which will be displayed in many locations in the GUI as well as in reports.
If no alias is defined, the host’s name will be used as an alias.

image::hosts_new_host_2.png[alt="Dialogue with host properties: alias and IP address."]

You have four options for configuring the IP address:

[cols="5,65,~", options="header"]
|===
|Option |Procedure |DNS happens
|1. |You enter _no_ IP address. The host name must be resolvable via DNS. |with xref:wato#activate_changes [activate changes]
|2. |You enter an IP address – in the standard dot notation. |never
|3. |Instead of an IP address you can alternatively enter a DNS-resolvable host name. |during check execution
|4. |Via xref:wato_rules#[rule set] [.guihint]#Hosts with dynamic DNS lookup during monitoring# you determine hosts for a dynamic DNS. The result is similar to 3., except that the the  [.guihint]#Hostname#  field is used for DNS query.  |during check execution
|===

With the 1st option, {CMK} uses cached data in order to minimise repeated DNS requests during the activation of the changes -- which is very
important for accelerating the activation procedure.
Furthermore, the cache ensures that a changed configuration can still be activated if the DNS stops working.

The catch is that {CMK} doesn't automatically notice the change to an address in DNS.
For this reason, in the [.guihint]#Properties of host# page there is the menu item [.guihint]#Hosts > Update DNS cache# which deletes the entire DNS cache and forces a new resolution the next time you activate the changes.
This file is found under `~/var/check_mk/ipaddresses.cache` in your site, by the way.
Deleting this file has the same effect as running [.guihint]#Update DNS cache#.

{CMK} incidentally also supports monitoring via *IPv6* -- also in dual stack.


=== Monitoring agents and custom attributes

The final important setting can be performed in the [.guihint]#Monitoring agents# and [.guihint]#Custom attributes# boxes.

image::hosts_new_host_3.png[alt="Dialogue with host properties: monitoring agents and custom attributes."]

The latter custom attributes shown here can be extended as desired, and can be used via xref:wato_rules#[rules] to configure all host and service parameters very efficiently. [.guihint]#Criticality# and [.guihint]#Networking Segment# are only examples.

It is more important to specify an entry under [.guihint]#Monitoring agents,# since this determines how the host transfers its data to the monitoring.

As xref:wato_monitoringagents#[monitoring agents] you can set:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|[.guihint]#{CMK} agent / API integrations#|The host should be monitored via the xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agent] (which must be installed of course). Select this setting also in the case of xref:datasource_programs#specialagents[special agents,], such as e.g., xref:monitoring_vmware#[VMware ESXi monitoring].
|[.guihint]#SNMP# |The host should be monitored via xref:snmp#[SNMP]. This selection allows the [.guihint]#SNMP credentials# field to appear below [.guihint]#SNMP#, with which you can define the SNMP community. Since this is generally the same for many hosts, it is rather recommended that it be defined in a folder. If nothing is specified `public` is automatically assumed.
|[.guihint]#Piggyback# |xref:piggyback#[Piggyback data] from other hosts will be used.
|[.guihint]#No API integrations, no {CMK} agent# |Such hosts are without agents and are monitored only with xref:active_checks#[active checks]. Rules for these are found under [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > HTTP, TCP, Email, ...#. If you don’t define at least one active check then {CMK} creates a PING service automatically. You can find those setting as an option of [.guihint]#{CMK} agent / API integrations.#
|===


[#labels]
=== Labels

A host can have any number of xref:labels#[labels].
Labels are similar to xref:wato_rules.html#hosttags[host tags], but unlike those, they do not have to be predefined -- you can assign them freely.

You assign a label to the host by first selecting [.guihint]#Labels#. Then click in the [.guihint]#Add some Label# field, enter the label definition in the form `key:value` and finish it with [Enter]. Use the crosses to remove labels.

image::hosts_labels.png[alt="Dialogue with host properties: labels."]

If you don't really need a value for a label, but just want to know whether a certain label is attached to the host or not, you can simply enter `yes` as value (`vm:yes`).
If you follow this scheme consistently, you will find it easier to define conditions for such labels later.

By the way, labels can also be automatically attached to hosts:
on the one hand by external connectors that automatically create hosts (e.g. automatically detected hosts in cloud environments), on the other hand by rules.


=== Saving and continuing

After creating or cloning a host, after setting the properties, the next logical step is [.guihint]#Save & go to service configuration.#
With this you enter the automatic service discovery, a subject we want to address in the next chapter.

On the other hand, [.guihint]#Save & go to connection tests# takes you into the connection test – with which you can test whether the settings being used produce any data at all from the agent.
Details about the connection test can be found in the xref:wato_monitoringagents#diagnosticpage[article on monitoring agents].


[#services]
== Configuring services

After creating a host the next step is the configuration of its services to be monitored.
All details for the automatic discovery and configuration of the services can be found in its xref:wato_services#[own article].
We will describe only the most important here.

There are various ways of accessing the list of a host's configured services in the Setup:

* via the host list:
+
Select [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts#. In the host list, click icon:icon_services[alt="Icon for showing the configured services."].

* via the properties of a host:
+
Select [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts#. In the host list, click the host. On the [.guihint]#Properties of hosts# page, select from the menu [.guihint]#Hosts > Save & go to service configuration#. If instead you select [.guihint]#Hosts > Service configuration# from the menu, you will also get to the service list -- but without saving the host properties.

You can also access this page in monitoring from the service list of a host: Select [.guihint]#Monitor > All hosts#. In the host list, click on the host. On the [.guihint]#Services of Host# page, for the [.guihint]#Check_MK Discovery# service, in the icon:icon_menu[alt="Icon for showing the action menu."] action menu select icon:icon_services[alt="Icon for showing the configured services."] [.guihint]#Edit services#.

Whichever way you choose, the result should look something like this:

image::hosts_services.png[alt="List of services found on the host."]

The most important actions are offered in the action bar, others can be found in the [.guihint]#Actions# menu.
Some notes on the possible actions:

* The [.guihint]#Fix all# button is usually the best action for a new host or for an existing host where services have been found that are currently not monitored: [.guihint]#Undecided services (currently not monitored#). [.guihint]#Fix all# adds the missing services, removes services that have vanished and takes over host labels that have been found. 

* The [.guihint]#Full service scan# button enables fresh, complete data to be
obtained from a target device. In order to ensure quick rendering of pages in
your browser, {CMK} oftentimes works with cached data, that is being logged during
regular monitoring. With SNMP devices the button starts an active search for new
check plug-ins and can possibly find further services.

* [.guihint]#Remove all and find new# is the same as a clearing and fresh detection of all services.
This is useful for services which can recall the state detected by a discovery (e.g., the current state of switch ports).

* You can display checkboxes in the list with [.guihint]#Display > Show checkboxes# and then select or deselect individual services.
+
However, this is only a temporary solution as the service discovery always highlights missing services.
Permanent ignoring requires clicking icon:icon_move_to_disabled[alt="Icon for disabling a service."], which permanently _disables_ the service.
With icon:icon_move_to_monitored[alt="Icon for adding a service to the monitoring."] you can bring a disabled service back into monitoring.

* As always after every change an xref:wato#activate_changes[activation of changes] is necessary in order for them to take effect.

* All further information can be found in the article on xref:wato_services#[service configuration.]


[#bulk_operations]
== Bulk actions

You may occasionally wish to perform tasks such as deleting, moving, editing or service discovery for a whole series of hosts simultaneously.
{CMK} provides so-called 'bulk actions' for this purpose.

You can find these actions on the page of an open folder in the [.guihint]#Hosts# menu in the [.guihint]#On selected hosts# section:

image::hosts_bulk_actions.png[alt="'Hosts' menu with the bulk actions.",width=40%]

The actions always apply for hosts that are located directly in a displayed folder -- and have been selected by you.
The checkboxes in the first column of the host list serve this purpose. 
If you click on the cross in the column title, all hosts are selected -- and deselected after clicking again.

You can restrict the selection of affected hosts in the list with checkboxes. Some of the actions will only be executed on selected hosts at all.

Here are a few tips for the actions offered:

* [.guihint]#Delete hosts# - Deletes the hosts -- after confirming the request.

* [.guihint]#Edit attributes# - Changes one or more attributes of the hosts.
The attribute is thereby entered explicitly in the hosts.
+
*Caution:* There is a difference between the host inheriting an attribute from a folder, and the attribute being set explicitly.
Why? In the latter case a change to the attribute in the folder would have no effect, as the values defined directly in the host always have priority.
For this reason, there is also the following action.

* [.guihint]#Removal explicit attribute settings# - With this you can delete explicit attributes from the selected hosts and reinstate inheritance.
The same result can be achieved by opening every host individually and deselecting the attributes via the checkboxes.
+
It is generally a good idea to use as few explicit attributes as possible.
When everything is inherited correctly via the folders, errors are reduced and the easy integration of new hosts is made possible.

* [.guihint]#Discover services# - xref:wato_services#bulk_discovery[Simultaneous discovery on multiple hosts.]

* [.guihint]#Detect network parent hosts# - xref:parents_scan[Creating parents using a scan.]

* [.guihint]#Move to other folder# - Move the hosts to another folder. After selecting this entry, the existing folders are offered as possible destinations.


[#search]
== Searching hosts in the Setup

{CMK} offers you the comfortable possibility to search in the xref:intro_gui#search_monitor[monitoring environment] (with the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu) and in the xref:intro_gui#search_setup[configuration environment] (with the [.guihint]#Setup# menu).
The results can be different because the hosts in the monitoring environment do not necessarily have to be the same as in the configuration environment: For example, if you have created a host in Setup without activating this change, it does not (yet) exist in the monitoring.

There is another option for host searching in the configuration environment, which has the advantage that you can search for hosts according to different criteria and the hosts found are listed on a results page from which you can start the bulk actions introduced in the previous chapter.

You can find this search again on the page of an open folder in the [.guihint]#Display > Search hosts# menu.
The search always preceds from the current folder recursively through all subfolders.
To search globally, simply use the search from the [.guihint]#Main directory#.

image::hosts_search.png[alt="Dialogue for searching hosts in a folder."]

In the [.guihint]#Hostname# field an _infix search_ is valid -- the entered text must only be a part of the host name.
Furthermore, you can restrict the search using other attributes.
All search terms are connected with _AND_.
The example in the above image illustrates a search for all hosts with [.guihint]#my# in their name that also have the [.guihint]#Test system# attribute.

With [.guihint]#Submit# you start the search.
The results page behaves almost like a normal folder.
This means that you can use the xref:bulk_operations[bulk actions] here, which are offered in the [.guihint]#Hosts# menu in the [.guihint]#On selected hosts# section, e.g. to move all hosts found to a specific folder.

If you don’t like the results, you can adjust and refine the search on the results page with [.guihint]#Refine search#.


[#import]
== Importing hosts from CSV data

If you wish to import a large number of hosts from a previous monitoring system or from an Excel table, you can make the task easier by importing
with the help of CSV data.
{CMK} is very flexible when reading such CSV data.
In the simplest case you just need a file in which every line contains a host name that can be resolved via DNS:

.import.csv
[{file}]
----
myserver01
myserver02
----

During an import it is also possible to take on additional attributes.
If the CSV data has attribute names in the first line, {CMK} can even assign these automatically.
To this end {CMK} attempts to use a tolerant rather than an exact syntax.
In the following data {CMK}  can automatically correlate all columns correctly:

.import.csv
[{file}]
----
hostname;ip address;alias;agent;snmp_ds
lnx17.example.com;192.168.178.48;Webserver;cmk-agent;
lnx18.exmpl.com;192.168.178.55;Backupserver;cmk-agent;
switch47-11;;Switch47;no-agent;snmp-v2
----

The procedure is as follows:
Select or create a folder into which the import is to take place.
Change to this folder and select icon:icon_bulk_import[alt="Icon for importing multiple hosts via CSV file format."] [.guihint]#Import hosts via CSV file# in the [.guihint]#Hosts# menu.

On the following page, either upload the file or select [.guihint]#Content of CSV File# and copy the file content into the field that appears below the list.
You can immediately have an automatic service discovery carried out on the newly imported hosts.
This is done with the [.guihint]#Perform automatic service discovery# option:

image::hosts_bulk_import_step1.png[alt="Dialogue for entering the CSV data for import."]

By clicking icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving the entries."] [.guihint]#Upload# you get the next page:

image::hosts_bulk_import_step2.png[alt="Dialogue for checking the CSV data for import."]

If the automatic recognition of a column doesn’t work you can manually select the attribute to be assigned.
For the host tags ([.guihint]#Tag#), the CSV data must contain the internal ID of the tag (here e.g. `cmk-agent` and not the title [.guihint]#{CMK} agent / API integrations# visible in the GUI).
The internal IDs can be found under [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Tags#, the IDs of the builtin tags in the article on xref:wato_rules#predefined_tags[host tags].

You start the import by clicking on icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving the entries."] [.guihint]#Import#.
If you have earlier selected [.guihint]#Perform automatic service discovery#, the will land on the xref:wato_services#bulk_discovery[Bulk discovery] page.
After completing the service discovery, all that is missing is the usual activation of the changes and all new hosts are in the monitoring.


[#parents]
== Creating parents

You have already learned what xref:monitoring_basics#parents[parents] are and how they work.
But how does one actually create parents?
The answer is typically {CMK}: there are a number of different procedures -- manually, per scan, or via the REST API.


=== Creating parents manually

A parent for a single host can be specified as follows:
Select [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts# and click on the desired host to display its properties.
In the [.guihint]#Basic settings# box, enter the parent using its name or IP address.
Once a parent has been specified, a further entry field for an additional parent will be opened:

image::hosts_properties_parents.png[alt="Dialogue with host properties: parents."]

*Important*: Only enter direct parent hosts.

Similarly, parents can also be defined in a folder’s attributes, and be inherited by the hosts they contain.
How this is achieved has already been seen in the chapter on xref:inheritance[inheritance of attributes].


[#parents_scan]
=== Creating parents using a scan

If the monitoring is a new installation, which from the very beginning has been planned with an orderly folder and parents structure, there should be no real problems with the inheriting of parents via folders.
However, parents can also be set up automatically using the [.guihint]#Parent scan#.

Via the IP protocol the scan searches for the last gateway before a host on the OSI model’s (layer 3) network layer using `traceroute`.
If such a gateway is found and its address belongs to one of your monitored hosts, this host will then be set as a parent.
If `traceroute` does not receive any information from the hops before the targeted host, the last successful hop is used.

If however no gateway with a monitored IP address is found, as standard {CMK} generates an artificial 'ping-only-host' by default in the [.guihint]#Parent# folder which will be simultaneously generated.

This default setting can also produce undesirable results.
For example, take a typical, small network with the address range _192.168.178.0/24._
If a host with an address in a different address space -- which cannot be pinged -- is added to the monitoring, the scan will attempt to access it via the router, and there it will find the node of the network provider.
Thus, for example, it can happen that a telecom server in the WAN network is set as a parent for this host.
This option can of course be deactivated.

If you wish to scan a folder with new hosts for parents, proceed as follows:

First open the desired folder and select [.guihint]#Hosts > Detect network parent hosts# in the menu to open the scan configuration. By the way, you can also scan a selection of hosts instead of an entire folder by selecting them in the first column of the list.

image::hosts_parent_scan.png[alt="Dialogue with the scan configuration for the parents."]

To fully scan in all hosts in all subfolders, independently of possible manually-installed parents, choose the [.guihint]#Include all subfolders# and [.guihint]#Scan all hosts# options.
In the [.guihint]#Performance# section you can limit the scan duration – which otherwise can take a very long time if there is a large number of hosts.

In [.guihint]#Creation of gateway hosts# specify if, how, and under which alias new parent hosts should be created.
Deactivate this function if it is to be restricted to parents on monitored hosts.

Now click [.guihint]#Start# at the bottom of the page.
The scan’s output can be followed live.

Afterwards, you will see the configured parents and, if applicable, a new folder [.guihint]#Parents# in the [.guihint]#Main directory# (if you specified this before the scan).

image::hosts_parents_list.png[alt="List of hosts with display of parents."]

This completes the scan.

After a scan has been performed and the changes have been activated, the parent-child relationships are visualised as a topology map, which you can call up via [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > Network Topology#.

image::hosts_parents_topology.png[alt"Network topology implemented from the parent-child relationships.",width=55%]

*Tip:* If the result of a scan appears to be implausible at any point, invoking `traceroute` manually can sometimes help with analysing the individual hops.


=== Creating parents with the REST API

For more experienced users there is the additional facility for configuring parents by using the xref:rest_api#[REST API].


[#rename]
== Renaming hosts

Renaming hosts -- on the face of it a simple matter -- turns out to be an
astoundingly-complex operation on closer inspection. The reason for this is that
{CMK} uses the host’s name as the unique key for the host – and this is used in
numerous locations. These include file names, log data, configuration rules, BI
aggregations, reports, dashboards and much more. The host name also appears in
URLs.

{CMK} has a specific action in the Setup for cleanly-renaming a host in all locations.
You can rename a single host (in the properties of the host in the menu [.guihint]#Hosts > Rename#) or a large number of hosts in a folder at once: in the menu [.guihint]#Hosts > Rename multiple Hosts#.

*Important:* Since changes in many different places for many hosts can also go wrong once in a while, you should make sure that you have an up-to-date xref:backup#[backup] of your site -- before you start the big renaming action.

By utilising intelligent operations, the [.guihint]#Bulk renaming of hosts# allows systematic name matching to be made:

image::hosts_bulk_renaming.png[alt="Dialogue for renaming multiple hosts."]

In the [.guihint]#Hostname matching# field, first optionally specify a regular expression that matches the *beginning* of the names of the hosts you want to rename -- in this example, all hosts whose names begin with `lnx`.
Then insert one or more operations to be applied *in order* to the host names.

In the above example, first [.guihint]#Drop Domain Suffix# truncates everything from the first `.` onwards from all host names and then [.guihint]#Add Suffix# adds the ending `-linuxserver`.

There are other operations available, some of which are self-explanatory, or for which you can get more information by showing the context-sensitive help ([.guihint]#Help > Show inline help#).


After starting the renaming with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon for saving the entries."] [.guihint]#Bulk rename# and confirming the obligatory 'Are you sure...?' query &#8230;

image::hosts_bulk_renaming_sure.png[alt="Dialogue for confirmation of host renaming."]

&#8230; the processing can take a while.
During the renaming the monitoring will be *completely stopped!*
This is necessary to keep everything in a consistent state.
On completion you will receive on overview listing which and where renames have taken place:

image::hosts_bulk_bulk_renaming_result.png[alt="Result of host renaming."]


[#host_groups]
== Host groups

Host groups are a part of the xref:monitoring_basics#[monitoring basics in {CMK}].
They enable a second layer of groups of hosts across the folder structure.
For example: your locations are displayed based on the folders.
Now you would like to be able to view all Linux, Windows and certain application servers together -- and create a host group for each of these server types.

In contrast to the situation in xref:wato_rules.html#hosttags[host tags], host groups do *not* appear as selection criteria in rules by default:
host groups serve the views, while host tags serve the configuration.

You can find host groups under [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Host groups#.


=== Creating a host group

A new host group is created via the [.guihint]#Add group# action button.

The creation is a trivial action, and is limited to specifying a unique name which cannot be changed later, and likewise an alias:

image::hosts_hostgroups_properties.png[alt="Dialogue with host group properties."]


=== Including hosts in a host group

To add hosts to a host group, try the [.guihint]#Assignment of hosts to host groups# xref:wato_rules#[rule set], which can be found in [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Host monitoring rules#.
Create a new rule in the desired folder.

First, in the [.guihint]#Assignment of hosts to host groups# box select the host group to which hosts are to be assigned -- in the example below  the "My Linux servers" group:

image::hosts_hostgroups_rule_assignment.png[alt="Dialogue for selecting the host group in a rule."]

Finally, in the [.guihint]#Conditions# box, take care of the filter or *the* filters to restrict the group -- because filters can of course also be combined.
You can filter hosts by folders, host tags and xref:labels#[host labels], or specify particular hosts.
Should you wish to add hosts with two tags from the same tag group to the host group, you will need to create two separate rules.
In general, the group assignments are cumulative.
Hosts can be in multiple groups and groups can be filled with multiple rules.

In the following example, we use the host label `cmk/os_family:linux` automatically assigned by {CMK} to add the Linux servers to the host group:

image::hosts_hostgroups_rule_conditions.png[alt="Dialogue for setting the conditions for the host group assignment."]

As usual, you still have to activate the changes afterwards.


=== Checking host groups

You can conveniently check the result of your assignments in the monitoring. Under [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > Host groups# the existing host groups are listed:

image::hosts_hostgroups_view.png[alt="Host groups view."]

Clicking on the name of a host group will take you to the complete view of the hosts in this group.


=== Using host groups

You can use host groups in several places:
to create table views and NagVis maps and as filters in rules for notifications and alert handlers.


==== Views

When creating xref:views#[table views] (via [.guihint]#Customize > Visualization > Views#), only the specification of the [.guihint]#Datasource# is important that uses host groups, e.g. [.guihint]#Hostgroups#.

In the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu you will find ready-made views, for example [.guihint]#Host groups#, which we have already shown in the previous chapter.


==== NagVis maps

You can access xref:nagvis#[NagVis maps] with the [.guihint]#NagVis maps# snapin of the xref:user_interface#sidebar[sidebar].
In a NagVis map you get as a result for example the summary for a host group via hover menu over a single icon:

[#folder_monitoring]
== The folder structure in the monitoring

The tree structure derived from the folders is also visible in monitoring environment.


[#filter_bar]
=== Filter bar

On the one hand, in the filter bar of xref:views#[table views], there is the [.guihint]#WATO Folder# filter, that you can use to restrict the current view to only those hosts below a particular folder:

[#tree_of_folders]
=== Tree of folders

Secondly, in the xref:user_interface.html#sidebar[sidebar], the  [.guihint]#Tree of folders# snapin offers the same selection option as the xref:user_interface#monitor_menu[Monitor menu], but can additionally restrict the display to one folder:

[#folders]
=== Folders

Finally, the [.guihint]#Folders# snapin shows a similar selection option for folders:

image::hosts_folders_snapin.png[alt="Folders snapin.",width=50%]

Here, the two snapins [.guihint]#Folders# and [.guihint]#Views# work together in the display: Once selected, a folder is retained even if you select a different view with [.guihint]#Views#.
This works for dashboards as well.
Try it out!
