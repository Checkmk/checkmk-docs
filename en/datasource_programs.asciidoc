== Introduction

{CMK} normally accesses its agents over a simple TCP-connection to Port 6556.
The ‘protocol’ is trivial: as soon the server opens the connection the agent
sends its data and then closes the port. The transferred data is in the form of
readable ASCII text.
This is esentially only the transfer of text data from agents to the server.

This radically simple principle enables the craziest variations with which
even the most unusual challenges can also be fulfilled – for example, those
arising out of special architectures for security or networks.
A variation of this, the transfer of data via SSH, will be described in the
article on the xref:agent_linux#ssh[Linux agents]. Here are a few further examples
of how one can get agent data to the {CMK} server:

* via email
* via HTTP-access from the server
* via HTTP-upload from the agents
* via access to a file that has been copied to the server using `rsync`
* via a script that uses HTTP to retrieve the data from a website


The universal methods for connecting such transfer procedures to {CMK} are the
[.guihint]#Datasource programs#. The idea is very simple: one gives a command line of
a command to {CMK}. Instead of connecting to Port 6556, {CMK} executes
this command. This produces the agent data on the _Standard Output_,
which is then processed by {CMK} in exactly the same way as if it had
come from a ‘normal’ agent.



== Writing from datasource programs


=== The simplest possible program

The writing and installation of a datasource program is not difficult.
Any Linux-supported script and program language can be used. The program is best stored
in the `local/bin` directory, where it will always be found automatically
without the need to specify a data path.

The following first very basic example is called `myds` and it generates
simple, fictional monitoring data.
These consist of one section `+<<<df>>>+`, which contains the
information for a single file system, and which has a size of 100kB and the name `My_Disk`.
It is coded as a shell script of three lines:

.local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
!/bin/sh
echo '<<<df>>>'
echo 'My_Disk  foobar  100 70 30  70% /my_disk'
----

Don't forget to make the program executable:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} chmod +x local/bin/myds
----

Now create a test host in WATO – e.g., `myserver125`. This does not
require an IP-address. In order to avoid {CMK} attempting to close
`myserver125` via DNS, enter this name as an explicit ‘IP-address’.

Next add a rule in the [.guihint]#Datasource Programs > Individual program call instead of agent access#
rule set which applies to this host, and enter `myds` as an executable
program:

image::ds_program.png[]


When you now go to the host's service configuration in WATO, exactly one service
ready to start monitoring should be listed:

image::ds_program_discovery.png[]


Add this service into the monitoring, activate the changes, and your first
datasource program will be running. For a test, as soon as you alter the data
being generated by the program the `My_Disk` file system's next check
will immediately show this.

=== Error diagnosis


If something is not functioning correctly, the host's configuration can be checked
by entering `cmk -D` in the command line (if your rule allows this.):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -D myserver125

myserver125
Addresses:              myserver125
Tags:                   /wato/, cmk-agent, ip-v4, ip-v4-only, lan, prod, site:beta, tcp, wato
Host groups:
Contact groups:         all
Type of agent:          [hilite]#Datasource program: myds#
----

With a `cmk -d` you can trigger the retrieval of the agent data
as well as the execution of your program:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -d myserver125
<<<df>>>
My_Disk  foobar  100 70 30  70% /my_disk
----

A duplicated `-v` should generate a message that your program will be invoked:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -vvd myserver125
Calling external program myds
<<<df>>>
My_Disk  foobar  100 70 30  70% /my_disk
----



=== Transferring a host's name


The program in our example actually works, but is not very useful as it always
produces the same data, regardless of which host it is invoked for.

A real program that, for example, retrieves data from somewhere,
requires at least the name of the host from where it should retrieve the data.
By coding `$HOSTNAME$` as a placeholder in the command line you can allow
this to be transferred:

image::ds_program_host.png[]


In this example the program `myds` receives the host name as its first argument.
The following program example produces this for testing in the form of a ‘local check’.
Via `$1` it takes the first argument and saves it for use as an overview in
the `$HOST_NAME` variable.
This will then be inserted into the local check's plug-in output:

.local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
!/bin/sh
HOST_NAME=$1

echo "<<<local>>>"
echo "0 Hostname - My name is $HOST_NAME"
----

The service discovery will then find a new service of the `local` type,
in the output from which the host name will be seen:

image::ds_program_discovery_host.png[]


From here it is only a small step to a real datasource program that, for example, retrieves data over HTTP
using the `curl` command. The following placeholders
are permitted in a datasource program's command line:

[cols="30,~"]
|===

|$HOSTNAME$ |The hostname, as it is configured under WATO.
|$HOSTADDRESS$ |The IP-address of the host over which it will be monitored.
|$_HOSTTAGS$ |The list of all of the host's attributes, separated by blank characters – enclose this argument in quotes to prevent it being split by the shell.
|===


If you have a dual-monitoring using IPv4 and IPv6, the following macros may be interesting for you:

[cols="30,~"]
|===

|$_HOSTADDRESS_4$ |The host's IPv4-address
|$_HOSTADDRESS_6$ |The host's IPv6-address
|$_HOSTADDRESS_FAMILY$ |The numeral `4` if the IPv4-address is used for the monitoring, otherwise `6`.
|===



=== Error handling

Regardless of your actual occupation in IT – much of your time will be spent
dealing with errors and problems. Datasource programs are not spared these.
Especially for programs that provide data over networks it is unrealistic to
expect them to be error-free.

In order that {CMK} can communicate an error to your program in
an orderly way, the following apply:

. Any exit code other than 0 will be treated as an error.
. Error messages are expected on the standard error channel (`stderr`).

If a datasource program fails,

* {CMK} discards the output's complete user data,
* {CMK} sets the {CMK}-service to {CRIT} and identifies the data from `stderr` as an error,
* and the actual services remain in their old state (and will age with time).

We can modify the above example so that it simulates an error.
With the redirection `&gt;&amp;2` the text will be diverted
to `stderr`, and `exit 1` sets the program's exit status to 1:


.local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
!/bin/sh
HOST_NAME=$1

echo "<<<local>>>"
echo "0 Hostname - My name is $HOST_NAME"

echo "This didn't work out" >&2
exit 1
----

In {CMK}-Service it will look like this:

image::ds_program_error.png[]


Should you be writing your program as a shell script, right at the beginning
you can code the `set -e` option:

.local/bin/myds
[{file}]
----
!/bin/sh
set -e
----

As soon as an instruction produces an error (i.e., exit code not 0), the shell
immediately stops and issues the exit code 1. You have thus a generic error
handling and must not check every single instruction for success.



[#specialagents]
== Special agents


A number of often-required datasource programs are delivered with {CMK}.
These generate agent outputs not just by calling a normal {CMK}-agent in a
roundabout way, rather they have been specially conceived for the querying of
particular hardware or software.

Partly because these programs require quite complex parameters, we have
defined special WATO-rule sets with which you can configure them directly.
All of these rules can be found under
[.guihint]#Host- & Serviceparamters > Datasource programs#:

image::ds_program_rules.png[]


These programs are also known as ‘Special Agents’, because they are a
_special_ alternative to the normal {CMK}-agents. As an
example, let us take the monitoring of NetApp-Filers.
These do not allow the installation of {CMK}-Agents. The SNMP-interface is
slow, flawed and incomplete. There is however a special HTTP-interface which
provides access to all monitoring data.

The `agent_netapp` special agent accesses via this interface and is
set up as a datasource program using the [.guihint]#Check NetApp via WebAPI# rule set.
It is important that in WATO the host retains the [.guihint]#{CMK} Agent (Server)# setting.

The data required by the special agent can then be entered into the rule's content.
This is almost always some sort of access data. With NetApp-agents there is also
an additional check box for the recording of performance data (which here can be
quite comprehensive):

image::ds_program_netapp.png[]

There are rare occasions in which it is desired that both a special agent,
as well as the normal agents are to be queried. An example for this is the
monitoring of xref:monitoring_vmware#[VMWare ESXi] over the vCenter.
This latter is installed on a (usually virtual) Windows machine, on which
reasonably enough a {CMK}-Agent is also running.


image::ds_program_vcenter.png[]

The special agents are installed under `share/check_mk/agents/special`.
If you wish to modify such an agent, first copy the file with the same name
to `local/share/check_mk/agents/special` and make
your changes in that new version.
