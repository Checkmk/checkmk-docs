== Introduction
[{image-left}]
image::grafana_logo.png[width=168]

{CMK} has an integrated xref:graphing#[graphing system] with comprehensive features for the visualization and storing of xref:glossar#metric[metrics].
However it might still be helpful to use link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana^] as an external graphing system --
for example, if you are already using Grafana and have other data sources connected to it and want to have a single, unified dashboard.

Beginning with version {v20}, in all {CMK} editions it is possible to directly address {CMK} as a data source in Grafana 8.x, and to display individual metrics -- or even entire graphs as predefined by {CMK} -- in Grafana.
In addition you can create your own graphs dynamically using xref:regexes#[regular expressions] to specify a set of hosts and services that should take specific metrics in the graph into account.

This article explains how to retrieve metrics from {CMK} and display these in Grafana.
For detailed instructions on how to use and configure Grafana, see the link:https://grafana.com/docs/[Documentation at Grafana Labs^].

The plug-in for Grafana is developed independently from {CMK}, thus it is not included with {CMK}, rather it is maintained in its own link:https://github.com/tribe29/grafana-checkmk-datasource[repository on GitHub^].
Since the plug-in has to be installed in Grafana, it makes no sense to bundle it with {CMK}.
An inclusion directly into Grafana currently is in review by the maintainers of Grafana.
Once this review has been completed, an installation directly from the Grafana user interface will be possible.


== Setting up the plug-in in Grafana

=== Installing the plug-ins

To install the plug-in, simply download the link:https://github.com/tribe29/grafana-checkmk-datasource/releases[zip file] with the latest version, and copy it – for example, with `scp` – to the Grafana server.

[{image-border}]
image::grafana_download_plugin.png[]

Alternatively, you can also load the file directly from the command line.
Note that you need to know the correct version for this.

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} wget https://github.com/tribe29/grafana-checkmk-datasource/releases/download/v2.0.2/tribe-29-checkmk-datasource-2.0.2.zip
----

Now unpack the archive:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} unzip tribe-29-checkmk-datasource-2.0.2.zip
----

Next, move the newly created folder to Grafana's plug-in directory.
Its path is usually: `/var/lib/grafana/plugins/`

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} mv -v tribe-29-checkmk-datasource /var/lib/grafana/plugins/tribe-29-checkmk-datasource
----

Change ownership to the Grafana user (typically `grafana`):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chown -R grafana:grafana /var/lib/grafana/plugins/tribe-29-checkmk-datasource
----

_Installation by cloning the Git archive_ (as stated in previous versions of this document) is no longer possible.

[#allow_unsigned]
=== Allowing unsigned plug-ins

As of Grafana 8.0, it is no longer possible to easily integrate external plug-ins if they have not been signed.
This applies to the {CMK} plug-in which is still under development, so that you also need an additional step.

To do so, open `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` in your favorite editor, navigate to the`[plugins]` section and modify the line `;allow_loading_unsigned_plugins =` as follows.
Make sure to remove the semicolon at the beginning of the line:

./etc/grafana/grafana.ini
[source,ini]
----
[plugins]
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = tribe-29-checkmk-datasource
----

With this setting you add an exception for this single plug-in.
If you are using Grafana in a (Docker) container, either link the custom INI file into the container or create a `volume` which you map to the directory in the container (`/etc/grafana`).
The following code blocks show an example of how to link the INI file using `--mount`.
Note that this is only an example and will probably not fit your environment exactly:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} sudo docker run -d pass:q[*--mount type=bind,source=/home/user/grafana/grafana.ini,target=/etc/grafana/grafana.ini*] -p 3000:3000 --name grafana -v grafana-plugins:/var/lib/grafana/plugins -v grafana-db:/var/lib/grafana grafana/grafana
----


=== Restarting the Grafana service

After changing the configuration file, updating or installing the plug-in, restart the Grafana service:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} service grafana-server restart
----

Afterwards the plug-in is available in the Grafana GUI, and from there can be activated and configured.


=== Activating and setting up the plug-in

Once the necessary files have been installed you can activate the plug-in in Grafana.
Go to the configuration and select the [.guihint]#Data sources# tab.
Here you can add a new data source using the [.guihint]#Add data sources# button:

image::grafana_plugins_overview.png[]

The entry for {CMK} can be found at the bottom of the category [.guihint]#Others#:

image::grafana_plugin_cmk.png[]

The configuration form for the data source is quite simple.
Enter the URL for your site and an automation user who has rights to access the Web API.
*Important:* In a xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed setup] with multiple sites, specify the URL for the _central site_ in the input field:

image::grafana_plugin_config.png[]

If you want to connect more than one {CMK} site, you can optionally add a unique name to each connection
-- otherwise simply leave the default `tribe-29-checkmk-datasource` as is.

After you have saved the connection with the [.guihint]#Save & Test# button, it will be available as a data source in Grafana and you can configure your first graphs.


== Creating graphs

=== Creating a blank dashboard

Dashboards are generated in Grafana using the ‘plus’ icon on the left side.
Clicking on [.guihint]#Dashboard# will open a new, blank dashboard:

image::grafana_new_dashboard.png[width=420]


[#singlemetric]
=== Displaying a single metric from a host

The simplest dashboard shows a single graph for a service on a host. 
This can also be the metric of a xref:glossar#local_check[local check] for which no prebuilt graphs exist.
In an existing dashboard or the one you just created, create a new [.guihint]#panel#.
First select [.guihint]#Add Panel# here:

image::grafana_dashboard_addpanel.png[]

Creating the panel immediately takes you to adding a new _Query._
In the [.guihint]#Data source# menu, select [.guihint]#tribe-29-checkmk-data-source#.

Access to data for visualization is slightly different between {CRE} and {CEE}:
In the {RE} you have to select from predefined  menus for site, host name, service and so on.
The {EE} provide more flexibilty by using cascades of filters.
This allows for very detailed selection, for example, by using regular expressions.
We have chosen an example for which you can action its configuration procedure in both {CMK} editions.

First choose the [.guihint]#Site#, then filter for the [.guihint]#Hostname# used in monitoring.
For the first test select an arbitrary host that uses the Windows or Linux agent.
As the [.guihint]#Service# choose [.guihint]#Check_MK#.
Set the type of [.guihint]#Aggregation# to [.guihint]#Lines#.
For the [.guihint]#Graph type# you have to select between [.guihint]#Single metric# or [.guihint]#Template#: 
Templates inherit metrics from {CMK} that may also contain combined graphs.
Our screenshots show the [.guihint]#Single metric# containing the [.guihint]#Time spent waiting for Checkmk agent#:

.Selecting metrics using filters in the {CEE}

.Selecting metrics using predefined menus in the {CRE}
image::grafana_dashboard_single_config_cre.png[]

Grafana will instantly show the result.
Now click on [.guihint]#Apply# to save the graph.
This brings you back to the dashboard where you click the floppy disk icon ([.guihint]#Save dashboard#) in the upper right area to save it.
Afterwards you'll be prompted to specify a title for the new [.guihint]#Dashboard#.

[#predefined]
=== Displaying a predefined graph from {CMK}

The developers of {CMK} already have aggregated many corresponding metrics into combined graphs to enable users to get a quicker overview on the various aspects of a single resource.
You can display the metrics from such a ready-made graph directly in Grafana.

The procedure starts in the same way as explained in the previous section, but differs at [.guihint]#Graph type# by selecting the [.guihint]#Template# entry and the [.guihint]#Template# of the service to be used.

image::grafana_dashboard_predefined_config.png[]

Once you are satisfied with the selection made, click the [.guihint]#Apply# button.
The graph will now be available in the selected dashboard. 

image::grafana_dashboard_predefined_view.png[]


[#complexgraphs]
=== Creating complex graphs

Especially in a dynamic cluster, you will often want to be able to track the entire history of a metric across all participating hosts without having to modify a graph each time a new node is added or removed.
To achieve this you have several options for dynamically customizing graphs.

The first way is to filter by [.guihint]#Host Labels# or [.guihint]#Host Tags# instead of selecting individual hosts.
Another option is to use xref:regexes#[regular expressions].
You can apply regular expressions to hosts or services.
In the example, `pass:[filesystem]` matches all services that contain `filesystem` -- no matter how many file systems a host has mounted.

image::grafana_dashboard_combined_config.png[]

The entry `pass:[filesystem.*nvme]` would narrow down the selection to all filesystems on NVME drives, regardless of the type of filesystem, since any string is allowed between `filesystem` and `nvme`.

In addition to the advanced filter options, with [.guihint]#Aggregation# you can specify the representation of the metrics in the graph, and with [.guihint]#Graph#, which graph should be used as a reference.
Note that metrics for a host/service will only be displayed if the host/service _also_ has this selected graph.
The example graph looks like this:

image::grafana_dashboard_combined_view.png[]


== Changes compared to previous versions

=== Omitted variables

Earlier beta versions allowed the display of metric names to be controlled using variables.
Here the following variables were allowed:

[cols="25,~",options="header"]
|===
|Variable |Description 
|`$title` |The title of the metric as it would be displayed in {CMK}.
|`$site` |The {CMK} site where the host and its metric are monitored.
|`$host` |The host to which the metric is assigned.
|`$service` |The service to which the metric is assigned.
|===

This feature was removed from version 2.0b1 of the plug-in because it actually duplicated a functionality that is already a part of Grafana.


=== Renaming via regular expressions

In the editing mode of each panel you find a [.guihint]#Transform# tab.
With the subitem [.guihint]#Rename by regex# you can reorder the naming of metrics or suppress information that is not needed.
Our following example searches two groups of characters that are separated by a comma and following space, swaps them and prepends `Service` und `Host`.

image::grafana_series_renaming_regex.png[]

The variables `$1` and `$2` here correspond to the strings 'captured' in the line above (_match groups_ or _capture groups_).
Grafana also allows for nested match groups.
An overview of their options is shown in the corresponding section in the xref:regexes#matchgroups[regular expressions article].


== Files and directories

[cols="30,~",options="header"]
|===
|File path |Description 
|`/var/lib/grafana/plugins/` |Grafana checks here for (new) plug-ins. Each plug-in gets its own subdirectory. Save the {CMK} plug-in here.
|`/etc/grafana/` |Configuration directory for Grafana.
|`/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` |Central configuration file for Grafana. Here you specify which unsigned plug-ins are allowed.
