== Introduction


[{image-left}]
image::linux.png[width=120]

Linux systems can be especially well monitored by {CMK}. This has less
to do with the {CMK} development team ‘feeling at home’ with Linux --
rather it has more to do with Linux being a very open system, and it
providing numerous very well documented and easily queried interfaces which
enable a comprehensive monitoring operation.

The installation of a monitoring agent is essential, since most of the
interfaces are not in themselves accessible over a network. For this
reason {CMK} has its own agent for the monitoring of Linux. This is easy
to install and is economical in its use of system resources.

The {CMK} agent for Linux is...

* ... *minimalistic*, since it requires little CPU, RAM and hard drive space.
* ... *transparent*, because it is a shell script, in which you can see which command it is executing.
* ... *secure*, since it permits no access from the network whatsoever.

The agent consists of a simple shell script that is installed in
`/usr/bin/check_mk_agent`, and which invokes *available system commands*
sequentially in order to seek data for the monitoring. It routes its output
using either `xinetd` or `systemd` to TCP-Port 6556, or it is
alternatively called per SSH. Should you like neither of these procedures
you can also implement your own methods for {CMK} to receive data from agents.

Monitoring of information that the standard agent doesn’t provide can be added
in the form of agent plug-ins. In the {EE} you can bundle all settings and
plug-ins together with the agent into an RPM or DEB packet using the
link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent Bakery], this packet can then be installed
with a single command and/or even be link:agent_deployment.html[updated] fully automatically.

== Installation

=== Various options

{CMK} provides a number of ways to install a Linux agent -- from the manual
installation of its separate components, to a fully automated deployment.
Some of these are only available in the {EE}:

=== Installation using a RPM/DEB-Packet

The agent files are located in the icon:icon_agents[]
[.guihint]#Monitoring agents# WATO module. In the {EE} this will lead to the
link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent Bakery]. From here, with the [.guihint]#Agent files# button
the list of the agent files can be opened:

[{image-border}]
image::agent_linux_agent_files.png[]

Everything required is in the first section called [.guihint]#Packaged Agents#.
Finished RPM and DEB packets for the installation of a Linux agent with
standard settings can be found here (the package for link:agent_windows.html[Windows]
with the `.msi` extension is also here):

image::packaged_agents.png[]


Whether you require RPM or DEB depends on the Linux distribution on which
the package is to be installed:

[cols="10,10,~"]
|===
|Packet |File extension |For installation on

|RPM |.rpm |Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE, SLES, and derivatives of these
|DEB |.deb |Debian, Ubuntu, and all other DEB-based distributions
|===



Attention: in the [.guihint]#Linux/Unix-Agents# section can be found the straight agent
scripts for the link:agent_linux.html#manual[manual installation] to `/usr/bin/`.
Only use these if the packaged agents do not function on your system, or if you
wish to monitor Unix derivatives other than Linux.

==== Exotic Linux distributions


Also, if the {CMK}-server only supports Enterprise-Linux distributions
that are still supported by their producer, the {CMK}-_agent_ is
in such a case much less demanding. It supports *every* Linux distribution –
even ancient ‘dinosaurs’ on which a Version 2.4 core is running!
It is however possible that not all plug-ins will run correctly in the agent,
but the basic monitoring itself will function.

==== Installation with RPM

The installation of an agent with the RPM package is very simple:


. Download the agent packet with the `*.rpm` file extension.
. Copy it to the target system to be monitored with `scp`, WinSCP or similar.
. Install it on that system as `root` using the `rpm -U` command.
. Next install the `xinetd` packet from your distribution, if it is not already installed.

Here is an example of a package installation:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} rpm -U check-mk-agent-1.6.0p11-1.noarch.rpm
----


By the way, the `-U` stands for ‘Update’, but it can also perform an
initial installation correctly. This means that the same command can also be
used later for an update to a newer version.

The subsequent installation of `xinetd` on Red Hat/CentOS is performed with:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} yum install xinetd
----

For SUSE Linux use `zypper`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} zypper install xinetd
----


Following the installation an agent is immediately active and can be queried
through TCP Port 6556.


==== Installation with DEB


This procedure is the same as for RPM, only the commands are different.
An installation and a later update of the agent are both performed with:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} dpkg -i check-mk-agent_1.6.0p11-1_all.deb
----

A subsequent installation of `xinetd`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt-get install xinetd
----

==== Get package via HTTP


Sometimes `scp` or WinSCP can be very laborious. The packet can also be
loaded directly from the {CMK}-server to the target system over HTTP.
For this purpose the agent file downloads have deliberately been made possible
_without needing a login_. The files after all contain no secrets. Anyone can download
and install {CMK} themselves and then access the files.


The easiest method is to use `wget`. The URLs can be identified via the browser.
If you know the package’s name you can simply assemble the URL name yourself.
Then simply set `/mysite/check_mk/agents/` before the file name:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} wget http://mycmkserver/mysite/check_mk/agents/check-mk-agent-1.6.0p11-1.noarch.rpm
----


RPM actually has an inbuilt `wget` -- with this you can perform the download and
the installation in a single action:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} rpm -U http://mycmkserver/mysite/check_mk/agents/check-mk-agent-1.6.0p11-1.noarch.rpm
----

=== Installation with the Agent-Bakery


{cee-only}
The {CEE} utilises the link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent-Bakery] via a
WATO-Modul to package individually-customised agents. This process will be
described in the general chapter covering the link:wato_monitoringagents.html[Agents].

Installation of the baked packets is performed exactly as described above.


=== Automatic updates


{cee-only}
If you use the agent bakery, the agent’s automatic updates can set this up.
This process is described in its link:agent_deployment.html[own article].



[#manual]
=== Manual installation


The manual installation of an agent is rarely necessary,
but is not very difficult. As well as the agent files from the site,
you also require the [.guihint]#Linux/Unix agents# selection menu -- here you will find
the [.guihint]#{CMK} Agent for Linux# file:

image::agent_linux_agents_manual.png[]


Load this file to the target system, and copy it to a directory that is
executable for `root`. `/usr/local/bin/` is very well suited
for this, since it is found in the search path and has been conceived for the
user’s own extensions. Here you can also work directly with `wget`:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} cd /usr/local/bin
{c-root} wget http://mycmkserver/mysite/check_mk/agents/check_mk_agent.linux
{c-root} mv check_mk_agent.linux check_mk_agent
{c-root} chmod 755 check_mk_agent
----


Please don’t forget the last two commands -- these remove the `.linux`
file extension and make the file executable. If everything has been done
correctly the agent should now simply be an executable command which will generate its usual output.
This also works if you are not in `/usr/local/bin`.
The `|{nbsp}head` truncates everything after the 11th line:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent | head
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.6.0p11
AgentOS: linux
Hostname: mycmkserver
AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
LocalDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local
<<<df>>>
----


In the case of a very old distribution which does not recognise the `timeout`
command, load the small program `waitmax` from the agent page (in the [.guihint]#z/OS# box) and install
it likewise in `/usr/local/bin`. Both `timeout` and `waitmax` perform
the same function -- they force a timeout when executing a program:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} timeout --help
Usage: timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
  or:  timeout [OPTION]
  Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.
----


Waitmax was developed as a {CMK} component at a time when `timeout`
was not widely used. It has almost the same call syntax:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} waitmax --help
age: waitmax [-s SIGNUM] MAXTIME PROGRAM [ARGS...]

Execute PROGRAM as a subprocess. If PROGRAM does not exit before MAXTIME
seconds, it will be killed with SIGTERM or an alternative signal.

   -s, --signal SIGNUM   kill with SIGNUM on timeout
   -h, --help            this help
   -V, --version         show version an exit
----


Should you wish to configure or extend the agent, you will need to create
the required directories yourself. The location for the three required
directories is hard coded in variables that begin with `MK_`,
and which will also be provided to the plug-ins over the environment:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} grep 'export MK_' check_mk_agent
export MK_LIBDIR="/usr/lib/check_mk_agent"
export MK_CONFDIR="/etc/check_mk"
export MK_VARDIR="/var/lib/check_mk_agent"
----

These three directories should be created (with the standard permissions
755):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} mkdir /usr/lib/check_mk_agent /etc/check_mk /var/lib/check_mk_agent
----


Should you want to change the file path, simply edit it in
`/usr/local/bin/check_mk_agent`.


If you fundamentally want to call up the agents over SSH, a configuration for
the `xinetd` is required, you just additionally need the SSH-configuration.
How that is achieved will be described link:agent_linux.html#ssh[below].


The configuration per `xinetd` enables an access of the agent data
via TCP Port 6556, and is the standard method in local networks.
Install the `xinetd` package for this, and create the following file:

./etc/xinetd.d/check-mk-agent
[{file}]
----
service check_mk
{
        type           = UNLISTED
        port           = 6556
        socket_type    = stream
        protocol       = tcp
        wait           = no
        user           = root
        server         = /usr/local/bin/check_mk_agent
        only_from      = 10.118.14.5 10.118.14.37
        disable        = no
}
----


Here enter the IP-Address of your {CMK}-server that will be permitted to access
the agent under `only_from`.
Then only an activation is required and the agent will be ready:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /etc/init.d/xinetd reload
----

If you’re using systemd, you should execute the following command instead:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} systemctl reload xinetd.service
----

== Testing, and error diagnosis

=== Overview

Once the agent has been installed, the obvious question will surely be how
to test whether everything has been done correctly. All of the possibilities
that are available from the {CMK}-server are
link:wato_monitoringagents.html#diagnostics[described] in the general chapter
on the agents. There are of course further diagnostic possibilities when one
is directly logged into the target system itself.


Since the ‘agent’ is basically nothing more than a simple program that obtains
data from your system and outputs it as loosely-formated text, you can also
invoke it as a program, and in fact do so quite easily:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.6.0p11
AgentOS: linux
Hostname: myhost123
AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
LocalDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local
<<<df>>>
udev              devtmpfs     8155492         4   8155488       1% /dev
tmpfs             tmpfs        1634036      1204   1632832       1% /run
/dev/sda5         ext4       226298268 176973752  37806104      83% /
none              tmpfs              4         0         4       0% /sys/fs/cgroup
----


Because the output can be rather long, `less` can also be very practical
here (you can quit it with the 'Q'-key):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent | less
----


This output does not of course prove whether the agent is also accessible over
the network. But in this way it can be tested whether all of the desired data
is present in the output.


Incidentally -- it is not essential to be `root` to be able to invoke
the agent, however it is possible that the output could be missing some information
which requires `root`-permissions to obtain
(e.g., multipath information and the output from `ethtool`).

=== Debug mode


So that possible erroneus outputs from defective plug-ins or commands do not
‘corrupt’ the real production data, as a matter of principle the agent suppresses
the standard error channel. If one is looking for a specific problem this can be
reactivated by invoking the agent with a special debug mode. This is done
with the `-d` option.
In so doing all of the shell commands which the agent executes will be output.


So that you can work with `less` here, the standard output and error
channels must be combined with `2>&1`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent -d 2>&1 | less
----

[#mrpe]
== Integration of classic check plug-ins

=== Executing plug-ins over MRPE


If you have migrated your monitoring from a Nagios-based solution to {CMK},
it cannot be ruled out that you have existing check plug-ins of a standard form
for which no counterpart in {CMK} (yet) exists. In most cases these will be
self-written plug-ins in Perl or Shell.


The {CMK}-agent offers a simple mechanism that enables such plug-ins still
to be used: _MK’s Remote Plugin Executor_ or _MRPE_ for short.
The name is intentionally an analogy to _NRPE_ in Nagios, for which it
performs the same function.


The MRPE is integral in agents and is configured with a simple text file
which you yourself can save in `/etc/check_mk/mrpe.cfg`.
In this file enter one plug-in call per line -- together with the name that
{CMK} should use for the service that is to be automatically created.
Here is an example:

./etc/check_mk/mrpe.cfg
[{file}]
----
Foo_Application /usr/local/bin/check_foo -w 60 -c 80
Bar_Extender /usr/local/bin/check_bar -s -X -w 4:5
----


If the agent is allowed to run locally, for each plug-in a new section will be
found with the title `+<<<mrpe>>>+`, containing the name,
exit code and output from the the plug-in. This can be verified with the
following practical `grep`-command:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent | grep -A1 '^...mrpe'
<<<mrpe>>>
(check_foo) Foo_Application 0 OK - Foo server up and running
<<<mrpe>>>
(check_bar) Bar_Extender 1 WARN - Bar extender overload 6.012|bar_load=6.012
----


The `0` or `1` in the output stand for the plug-in’s exit codes
and conform to the standard pattern: `0` = {OK}, `1` =
{WARN}, `2` = {CRIT} and `3` = {UNKNOWN}.


The rest will be taken care of by {CMK} automatically. Once a service discovery
has been performed for the host, the two new services will be shown as
link:wato_services.html#available[available]. It will look like this:

[{image-border}]
image::agent_linux_mrpe_checks.png[]


Incidentally: due to the file’s syntax the name is not permitted to contain blank characters.
With the help of the same syntax as used in URLs, a space can be replaced by
`%20` (the ASCII-Code 32 for ‘space’ is Hexadecimal 20):

./etc/check_mk/mrpe.cfg
[{file}]
----
Foo%20Application /usr/local/bin/check_foo -w 60 -c 80
Bar%20Extender /usr/local/bin/check_bar -s -X -w 4:5
----


[#async_plugins]
=== Asynchronous execution


Please note that all plug-ins running in `mrpe.cfg` will be executed
synchronously and sequentially.
The plug-ins should thus not have overly long runtimes. If a plug-in hangs,
all following plug-ins will be delayed. This could lead to the agent’s complete
retrievals under {CMK} entering a timeout, meaning that the host can no longer
be reliably monitored.


If you really require longer running plug-ins, these should be converted to
asynchronous processing, thus avoiding the problem described above.
For this, define a time frame in seconds for which a calculated result will be
valid -- for example, `300` for five minutes.
To achieve this, set the expression `(interval=300)` following the service
name in `mrpe.cfg`:

./etc/check_mk/mrpe.cfg
[{file}]
----
Foo_Application (interval=300) /usr/local/bin/check_foo -w 60 -c 80
Bar_Extender /usr/local/bin/check_bar -s -X -w 4:5
----

This will have a number of effects:


* The plug-in will be executed in a background process and will no longer hinder the agent’s processing.
* Because the agent no longer waits for the execution, the result will be delivered until the _next_ call of the agent.
* The plug-in will not be run before the defined 300 seconds have elapsed. Until that time the old result will be recycled.


With this method tests that require very long processing times,
as well as longer intervals, can also be run without needing to make changes to
the configuration on the {CMK}-server.


=== MRPE with the Agent Bakery


{cee-only}
Proud owners of the {EE} can also configure MRPE with the
link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent Bakery]. The rule set
[.guihint]#Monitoring Agents > Rules > Generic Options > Execute MRPE Checks# is responsible for this.
There you can configure the same things as described above.
The appropriate `mrpe.cfg` file will then be automatically generated by the bakery.

image::agent_linux_mrpe_rule.png[]

==== Baking the plug-ins


Likewise the Check plug-ins themselves can be delivered with the package.
With these the agent will be complete and will require no manual installation
of additional files. This is all performed as follows:


. Create the directory `local/share/check_mk/agents/custom` on the {CMK}-server
. Create a subdirectory, e.g. `my_mrpe_plugins` in the above directory
. Then create the subdirectory `bin` in this
. Copy your plug-ins to this directory
. Create a rule in [.guihint]#Monitoring Agents > Rules > Generic Options > Deploy custom files with agent#.
. Select `my_mrpe_plugins`, save and bake it!


The Check plug-ins will be installed in your agent’s standard-`bin`-directory.
By default this is `/usr/bin`. Then when configuring the MRPE-checks,
`/usr/bin/check_foo` will be required instead of `/usr/local/bin/check_foo`.


[#plugins]
== Extending agents with plug-ins

=== What are plug-ins?


The standard agent `/usr/bin/check_mk_agent` contains a whole series of
sections which provide monitoring data for various checks which will then be
found automatically by a service discovery. These include all of an operating
system’s important monitorings.


Additionally, there is also the possibility of augmenting an agent with plug-ins.
These are small scripts or programs which are invoked by an agent to include
further sections with additional monitoring data. The {CMK}-Project delivers
a whole series of such plug-ins, which -- when correctly installed and configured --
via a service discovery can provide new checks automatically.


Why are these plug-ins not simply built into the standard agent?
For each plug-in one of the following reasons prevents such an integration:


* The plug-in is coded in a programming language other than Shell and thus cannot implemented inline (example: `mk_logwatch`).
* The plug-in in any case requires a configuration without which it will not function (example: `mk_oracle`).
* The plug-in is so specialised that most users will not require it (example: `plesk_domains`).


[#manualplugins]
=== Manual installation of plug-ins


The plug-ins for Linux and UNIX included with the project are all located on the
{CMK}-server in `share/check_mk/agents/plugins`.
Additionally, these are available via the download page for the agents in WATO (as
described at the beginning of this article) in the [.guihint]#Linux/Unix Agents - Plugins# menu box:

image::agent_linux_files_agent_plugins.png[]


For all of our standard agent plug-ins there are also the matching check plug-ins
which can evaluate the data and create services from these. They are ready to use
and do not require an extra installation.


Before installing a plug-in in an agent, please have a look at its associated file.
Important tips for the correct use of the plug-in can often be found there.


The actual installation is then simple: simply save the file to
`/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins`.
When doing this ensure that the file is _executable_.
If not, use a `chmod 755`, otherwise the agent will not run the plug-in.
Especially if the files are not transferred over `scp`, rather via HTTP
from the download page, the execution permissions will be lost!


Once a plug-in is executable and in the correct directory, it will be invoked
by the agent and a new section will be generated in the agent’s output.
This section usually has the same name as the plug-in. Complex plug-ins (e.g.,
`mk_oracle`) in fact create a whole series of sections.

In older versions of the {CMK} agent the plug-in directory can be in another
location.
If case of uncertainty, or you don’t know if this applies in your setup, the directory can be identified with the following:

[#install_plugin]
[{shell}]
----
{c-root} grep MK_LIBDIR= /usr/bin/check_mk_agent
export MK_LIBDIR="/usr/lib/check_mk_agent"
----

[#pluginconfig]
=== Configuration of plug-ins


Some plug-ins require a configuration file in `/etc/check_mk/` to be able
to function. With others a configuration is optional and allows special features or
customisation. Others simply work as is. There are various sources of relevant information:


* The documentation for the matching check plug-ins in the [.guihint]#Check plugins# WATO-module
* Comments in the plug-in itself (often very helpful!)
* A relevant article in this handbuch (e.g., on the monitoring of link:monitoring_oracle.html[Oracle])


=== Asynchronous execution


Plug-ins can process asynchronously in the same way as with MRPE.
This is very useful if the plug-ins have a very long runtime,
and the acquired status data in any case does not need to be refreshed every minute.


An asynchronous execution is not configured with a file. Instead, create a subdirectory
in `plugins` whose name is a numeric, representing a count in seconds. Plug-ins in this
directory will not only be executed asynchronously, at the same time by specifying the second
count a minimum waiting time is also specified before the plug-in can be run again.
If the agent is again called before the specified time has elapsed, it will use
cached data from the last run of the plug-in. In this way an interval longer than
the typical one minute can in effect be configured for the plug-in.


The following example shows how by specifying a 5 minute interval the `my_foo_plugin`
plug-in can be changed from synchronous to asynchronous execution:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} cd /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
{c-root} mkdir 300
{c-root} mv my_foo_plugin 300
----


Please note that a few plug-ins are set up internally to execute
asynchronously by default. Among these is `mk_oracle`.
Always install such plug-ins directly in `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins`!


=== Installing plug-ins using the bakery


Plug-ins included with {CMK} can be configured using the
link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent Bakery]. This not only takes care of the installation
of the plug-ins themselves, but also for the correct generation of the configuration file
should one be required.


Each plug-in is configured with an agent rule. The appropriate rule set can be
found in [.guihint]#Monitoring agentes > Agent plugins#:

image::agent_linux_rules_agent_plugins.png[]


=== Manual execution of plug-ins


Since agent plug-ins are executable programs, for testing and diagnosis
they can be manually started. There are however plug-ins which require specific
environment variables to be set by agents -- so that they can find their
configuration file, for example. Set these variables manually before execution:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} export MK_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/check_mk_agent
{c-root} export MK_CONFDIR=/etc/check_mk
{c-root} export MK_VARDIR=/var/lib/check_mk_agent
{c-root} /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/mk_foobar
<<<foobar>>>
FOO BAR BLA BLUBB 17 47 11
----


Some plug-ins have special invocation options for debugging. Just have a look in the plug-in!

[#security]
== Security

=== Considerations


Nowadays everything must be _safe_ -- and of course monitoring is no exception.
Because the monitoring agent is installed on every server being monitored,
a security problem here can have serious consequences.


For this reason emphasis is placed on security in the design of {CMK},
and from the earliest days of {CMK} security has been an unshakeable principle:
_An agent reads no data from the network -- full stop._ Consequently it is
quite impossible that an attacker could sneak any type of command or script
element over the monitoring port 6556.


This alone provides such a high level of security that most users do without
additional measures _in the LAN_.
If the system being monitored is only accessible over an insecure internet connection,
then of course quite different precedures are necessary, and an encryption
with SSH would certainly be the ideal first choice.


The {CMK} agent additionally includes an
_inbuilt encryption_, which represents a good compromise between security and
complexity.
In the following section we will show all of the options for protection in detail.


=== Restricting of access over IP-addresses


Even if an attacker is unable to execute commands, the monitoring data could
be useful to him as among other info, the data includes a list of all processes
running on the system. Is is therefore best that the data is accessible to nobody.


==== xinetd


If the {CMK}-agents are as usual enabled over the `xinetd`, it is very
simple and effective to restrict the access to specific IP-addresses -- to those
of the monitoring server of course. This is easily done, and was in fact
to be seen in the example above:

./etc/xinetd.d/check-mk-agent
[{file}]
----
service check_mk
{
        type           = UNLISTED
        port           = 6556
        socket_type    = stream
        protocol       = tcp
        wait           = no
        user           = root
        server         = /usr/bin/check_mk_agent
        only_from      = 10.118.14.5 10.118.14.37
        disable        = no
}
----


Agent Bakery users can configure the permitted IP-addresses using the WATO rule set
[.guihint]#Monitoring agents > Rules > Generic options > Allowed agent access via IP address#.


An attacker can of course easily falsify their IP-address and thus make a connection
to an agent -- but it is very unlikely that it will receive an answer since this goes
to the genuine monitoring server. Or it really does receive an answer, but the
{CMK}-server looks down the pipe and will very quickly record an error.


==== Systemd


Since Systemd is now the new toy that everyone uses, Linux distributors are
working hard to retire the good old xinetd. The prepackaged Linux-Agent (not
one from the Bakery!) already installs itself with Systemd instruments,
if the target system is based on Systemd and _no_ xinetd is available.


Systemd however cannot perform such simple tasks as `only_from`.
One will be bluntly referred to `iptables`.
Should your agent thus, without xinetd, be invoked purely with Systemd,
there is unfortunately no simpler possibility for restricting the IP-addresses,
other than using a firewall configuration.


If you are not yet one of the Systemd evangelists, there is however a simple
alternative: Even in Systemd-based systems it is (still) possible to use xinetd.
This can be run as a service under Systemd -- and again the method with
`only_from` as described above also works. To this end install
the `xinetd` packet, and then _reinstall_ the {CMK}-agent -- this
should then find and preferentially install xinetd.


[#ssh]
=== Invoking over SSH


The ultimate security for invoking a {CMK}-agent is offered by invoking it
via Secure Shell -- in Linux in the form of an implementation of _OpenSSH_.
This method is advisable for:


* The monitoring of Linux servers that are only accessible over the internet.
* The monitoring of computers in a DMZ.
* Similar situations in which a TCP-connection from the {CMK}-Server to the agent is at all possible.

The setting-up is performed in the following steps:


. Create an SSH-key pair especially for this purpose.
. Enable an access to the agent on the target system using these keys.
. Disconnect the access over xinetd.
. Configure the {CMK} server to use SSH instead of the TCP connection on port 6556.


And now the above procedure, step-by-step with all necessary details:


==== Creating SSH-key pairs


SSH works with a ‘Public-Key-Authorization’. For this purpose first create
a pair of complementary keys -- one of which is public, and the other private.
This is performed by an instance user with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ssh-keygen -t ed25519
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/omd/sites/mysite/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /omd/sites/mysite/.ssh/id_ed25519.
Your public key has been saved in /omd/sites/mysite/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
cc:87:34:d2:ed:87:ed:f7:1b:ec:58:1f:7c:23:00:e2 mysite@mycmkserver
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519  256--+
|                 |
|       . .       |
|      ..+..      |
|      .=.+.o     |
|       ES +.o    |
|         . o. o  |
|            ...B.|
|             .=.*|
|             . o+|
+-----------------+
----


Important: *do not* enter a passphrase here! Encrypting the file with
the secret key will not achieve anything, because you won’t want to have to
enter the passphrase every time you start the {CMK}-server...

This will result in two files in the `.ssh` directory:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll .ssh
total 8
-rw------- 1 mysite mysite 1679 Feb 20 14:18 id_ed25519
-rw-r--r-- 1 mysite mysite  398 Feb 20 14:18 id_ed25519.pub
----


The private key is called `id_ed25519`, and is only readable for the instance
user (`-rw-------`) and that is what we want!
The public key `id_ed25519.pub` will look something like this:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGb6AaqRPlbEmDnBkeIW3Q6Emb5lr2QEbWEQLmA5pb48 mysite@mycmkserver
----


==== Enabling access over SSH


The next step must be carried out on every Linux server that is to be
monitored over SSH. Log in to the server as `root`, and -- if it
does not already exist -- create the subdirectory `.ssh` in
the (`/root`) home directory:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} mkdir /root/.ssh
----


The permissions for this directory *must be* `700`, so that it
will be recognised by SSH. If you have created the directory yourself,
you will also require:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod 700 /root/.ssh
----


Now open the `authorized_keys` file with the (console-based) text
editor of your choice. If the file does not already exist, it will be
generated automatically by the editor:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} vim /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
----


Now copy the content of the public keys into this file. This can be done,
for example, with the mouse and copy & paste. Be precise! Every blank character
is valid. Be careful to *never* have *two* blank characters 
together, -- AND, all of this is a *single line*!
If the file already exists, simply add this as a new line at the end of the file.


==== Restricting access to agent execution


Now for something very important! The SSH-key should be used _exclusively_
for executing the agent. SSH offers such a function under the name
[.guihint]#Command restriction#. For this, set the text `command="/usr/bin/check_mk_agent"`
at the beginning of the line which has just been created -- separated from
the rest with *one* blank character. The result will look like this:

./root/.ssh/authorized_keys
[{file}]
----
command="/usr/bin/check_mk_agent" ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGb6AaqRPlbEmDnBkeIW3Q6Emb5lr2QEbWEQLmA5pb48 mysite@mycmkserver
----


Save the changed file, and check the permissions -- they *must* be set to `600`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
{c-root} ll /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
[hilite]#-rw-------# 1 root root 1304 Feb 20 14:36 authorized_keys
----


Now an access via SSH to the agent from the monitoring server should be possible.
This can be checked with:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} ssh root@myhost123
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 55:34:f9:dd:2b:db:a7:fc:5d:4c:9d:37:28:f7:69:62.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.6.0p3
AgentOS: linux
Hostname: myhost123
AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
LocalDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local
<<<df>>>
----


By the way, the request for the [.guihint]#key fingerprint# is received
only with the initial use. Should this not function, check the following:

* Is the SSH-server actually installed on the target system?
* Do the specified files and directories have the correct permissions?
* Has the syntax in `authorized_keys` been coded correctly?
* Has the correct public key been entered?
* Have you logged in as the correct user (`root@...`)?
* Have you thought of the `command="...."`?


==== Disconnecting access over xinetd


The implementation of SSH is not much use if the access over Port 6556
remains possible as before.
To close the port, set {CMK}’s xinetd-service to `disabled`.
Do _not_ delete the complete configuration file, as this will then
reappear with the next agent update anyway!

Disabling is performed in `/etc/xinetd.d/check-mk-agent`:

./etc/xinetd.d/check-mk-agent
[{file}]
----
service check_mk
{
        type           = UNLISTED
        port           = 6556
        socket_type    = stream
        protocol       = tcp
        wait           = no
        user           = root
        server         = /usr/bin/check_mk_agent
        disable        = yes
}
----

Following the restart of xinetd, do not forget:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
----


A deinstallation of xinetd is of course also possible -- but with the next
update of the {CMK}-agent it will reactivate itself in any case over Systemd!


Under no circumstances forget to test the setup at the end of this precedure.
A connection to Port 6556 should no longer be possible:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} telnet myhost123 6556
Trying 10.118.15.23...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
----


==== Migrating {CMK}’s access to SSH

The target system is now ready. Next you have to take care of the configuration
of {CMK} itself. You will find the suitable rule set via [.guihint]#Setup >
Agents > Other integrations> Individual program call instead of agent access#.
Create a rule for the affected hosts, and enter the command `ssh -T
root@$HOSTADDRESS$`:

image::agent_linux_rule_ssh_key.png[]

After saving and an [.guihint]#Activate changes# everything should function as intended!
For diagnostic purposes the commands `cmk -D` and `cmk -d` are well
suited, as explained in the link:cmk_commandline.html#utilities[article on the command line].


==== Multiple SSH-keys

It is also possible to work with more than one SSH-key. Save the keys to any chosen
directory. With ‘Datasource program’ the data path to the appropriate private key
must include the _-i_ option. Ideally, use `$OMD_ROOT` as the substitute for the
path to the instance directory (`/omd/sites/mysite`). The complete command could
be `ssh -i $OMD_ROOT/.ssh/my_key -T root@$HOSTADDRESS$` and like this the
configuration will also be runable in an site with a different name:

image::agent_linux_rule_multiple_ssh_keys.png[]

Different host groups can use different SSH-keys, if multiple different rules are
used.


==== Typical error messages when dealing with ssh

When you setup agent acccess via ssh you might encouter error messages in the
summary of the critical service _Check_MK_, like _Agent exited with code 255_.

Information on how to resovle such errors can be found in the the dedicated
article link:https://kb.checkmk.com/display/KB/Executing+the+Linux+agent+over+ssh[Executing the Linux agent over ssh] in our link:https://kb.checkmk.com[Knowledge Base].


[#encryption]
=== Inbuilt encryption

The {CMK} agent can encrypt its own data without additional tools.
Strictly speaking, this is no substitute for an access control. But since an
attacker cannot send commands, and can’t work with encrypted output data,
as a solution this is nearly as effective.


The complexity with the use of encryption and the additional CPU-load incurred
are both less than with the SSH method as described above, the method which we
nevertheless still recommend when transferring data over the internet.


The encryption of course requires a suitable configuration, both on the server
and in the agents.
This can be created manually ({RE}) or with the Agent Bakery ({EE}).


==== Installation without the Bakery

Even without the Agent Bakery the first step is still performed in _Setup_ by
creating a [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Access to Agents > Encryption# rule in
the rule set. The rule should apply to all hosts for which an encryption will be
implemented. SNMP-hosts ignore this setting, so it is not necessary to
explicitly exclude them.

image::encrypt_agent.png[]


Important is the [.guihint]#Encryption for agent# setting. As long as the rule retains
the default [.guihint]#Disable#, everything naturally remains as in the old setup.
The choice is thus between:


* [.guihint]#Enable#: Encryption is active, but data from unencrypted agents will continue to be accepted.
* [.guihint]#Enforce#: Encryption is active, and only encrypted data will be accepted.


It makes sense to begin with [.guihint]#Enable# initially. Once you are satisfied that
all agents have been converted to encryption, switch over to [.guihint]#Enforce#,
in order to identify hosts which still send data as clear text.


The encryption makes use of a shared password which must be stored on both the
{CMK}-Server and on the agent as a simple text (‘Shared secret’),
and which will be entered here. Choose a random password and have it ready for
the second step -- the configuration of the agent.

Create the file `/etc/check_mk/encryption.cfg` with the following contents on the agent:

./etc/check_mk/encryption.cfg
[{file}]
----
ENCRYPTED=yes
PASSPHRASE='XEwks9fm'
----


Of course use your own password in `PASSPHRASE`. This file should definitely
be secured against reading by other users:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} chmod 600 /etc/check_mk/encryption.cfg
----


Now the following tests can be made (for information on these, see the
link:cmk_commandline.html[article on {CMK}’s command line]):


* An invocation of `check_mk_agent` on the target system should produce a nonsense jumble of characters.
* A `telnet myhost123 6556` from the {CMK}-server should produce the same jumble.
* A `cmk -d myhost123` on the {CMK}-server should show the normal clear text.


==== Implementing with the Bakery


{cee-only}
The implementation of the encryption with the agent bakery is very simple.
By creating the rules as just described, one is basically finished. Now only new
agents need to be baked and distributed. The file `/etc/check_mk/encryption.cfg`
will be automatically generated and added to the agent package.


[#snmp]
== Monitoring Linux over SNMP

Since an easily-installed SNMP-Agenten is available for Linux, the question arises
whether it is possible or even desirable to monitor Linux over SNMP?
The answer is quite simple: possible yes, sensible no. Why is this so?

* The monitoring data from the SNMP-agents is very limited, so that in any case {CMK}-agents are required for a halfway adequate monitoring.
* The SNMP-agent delivers no useful data that isn’t already provided by the {CMK}-Agent.
* The SNMP-agent is more time-consuming to install.
* Last but not least, the SNMP protocol consumes far more CPU and network resources than a normal {CMK} monitoring.

There are however a few situations in which monitoring per SNMP
*in addition to* the normal agents can be sensible. Such a case would be
when either a user's software, or a hardware monitoring tool supplied by the
server’s manufacturer only delivers data via SNMP.

For such a situation, at the host’s characteristics in the [.guihint]#Data sources#
submenu in WATO, set the [.guihint]#Check_MK Agent# to one of the options starting with
[.guihint]#Normal {CMK} agent# and the option [.guihint]#SNMP# to either [.guihint]#SNMP v2 or v3# or
[.guihint]#SNMP v1#. Services that are accessible over SNMP as well as per {CMK}-agent
(e.g. CPU-load, file systems, network cards) will be automatically retrieved by
{CMK}-agent and not over SNMP. In this way a duplicated data transfer will be
automatically prevented.


== Hardware monitoring

=== Fundamentals


To be as comprehensive as possible the monitoring of a Linux-server must of
course include the hardware. This is achieved in part directly with the {CMK}-agents,
and partly also using special link:agent_linux.html#plugins[plug-ins].
Additionally, there are also cases in which monitoring can be implemented per SNMP,
or even over a separate management board.


=== Monitoring the SMART-values


Modern hard drives almost always use S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring,
Analysis and Reporting Technology). This system continuously logs data on the condition
of the HDD or SSD, and with the `smart` plug-in {CMK} can retrieve
these values and evaluate the most important of them. In order that the plug-in
functions after an installation, the following preconditions must be met:


* The `smartmontools` packet must be installed. This can be installed on all modern distributions with the appropriate packet manager.
* If the drives are connected via a RAID-controller and this allows access to the SMART-values, the appropriate tool must also be installed. `tw_cli` (3ware) and `megacli` (LSI) are supported.

If these prerequisites have been satisfied, and the plug-in has been installed,
the data will be automatically read and appended to the agent’s output.
In {CMK} the link:wato_services.html#available[new services] can then also be activated directly:

image::agent_linux_smart_stats.png[]

=== Monitoring with the help of IPMI


IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is an interface for hardware
management which, among other functions, enables the monitoring of hardware.
{CMK} uses freeipmi for this, in order to access the hardware directly
and without a network. It is installed from the package source and is ready for
immediate use, so that the data will be transmitted at the next polling by {CMK}.


If `freeipmi` is not available, or there are other grounds preventing an
installation, `ipmitool` can also be used. This is often already present
on a system and must only served by an IPMI hardware driver -- which can be provided
by the `openipmi` package, for example.
Likewise, nothing more needs to be done here subsequently. The data will be
recorded by {CMK} automatically.


For error diagnosis the tools can also be executed manually in a host shell.
If the `freeipmi` packet has been installed it can be used to control the function:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} ipmi-sensors Temperature
32 Temperature_Ambient 20.00_C_(1.00/42.00) [OK]
96 Temperature_Systemboard 23.00_C_(1.00/65.00) [OK]
160 Temperature_CPU_1 31.00_C_(1.00/90.00) [OK]
224 Temperature_CPU_2 NA(1.00/78.00) [Unknown]
288 Temperature_DIMM-1A 54.00_C_(NA/115.00) [OK]
352 Temperature_DIMM-1B 56.00_C_(NA/115.00) [OK]
416 Temperature_DIMM-2A NA(NA/115.00) [Unknown]
480 Temperature_DIMM-2B NA(NA/115.00) [Unknown]
----


Once `ipmitool` has been installed the data output can be checked
with the following command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} ipmitool sensor list
UID_Light 0.000 unspecified ok na na 0.000 na na na
Int._Health_LED 0.000 unspecified ok na na 0.000 na na na

Temp_2 16.000 degrees_C ok na na -64.000 na na na
Power_Meter 180.000 Watts cr na na 384.00
----

=== Manufacturer-specific Tools


Many server producers offer their own tools for recording hardware
information and delivering this via link:agent_linux.html#snmp[SNMP].
The following prerequisites apply to be able to retrieve this data and
provide it to {CMK}:


* An SNMP-server has been installed on the Linux host.
* The manufacturer's tool has been installed -- e.g., Dell’s _OpenManage_ or Supermicros _SuperDoctor_.
* The host has been configured in {CMK} for an additional monitoring per link:agent_linux.html#snmp[SNMP].


The new services for hardware monitoring thereby supported will then be
automatically recognised. No further plug-ins will be required.

=== Supplementary monitoring over the Management Board


A management board can be configured for every
host and additional data collected per SNMP. The services thereby recognised will
likewise be assigned to the host.


Setting up a management board is very easy. In the host’s attributes, just enter
the protocol, the IP-address and the access data for SNMP, and save the new settings:

image::agent_linux_snmp_management_board.png[]


With a service discovery the newly-discovered services will then be activated as usual.
