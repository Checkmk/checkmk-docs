For pages that you visit again and again, you can create bookmarks in the sidebar with the [.guihint]#Bookmarks# snapin.

Do you really need these? 
After all, there are bookmarks in the web browser.
Well, the {CMK} bookmarks have a couple of advantages of their own:

* A called bookmark only changes the content on the main page without reloading the sidebar.

* You can share bookmarks with other users.

* When setting bookmarks, the re-execution of actions is automatically prevented.

At first, the Bookmarks snapin is still empty:

If you now click [.guihint]#Add Bookmark#, a new bookmark will be created for the content currently displayed on the main page:

Your personal bookmarks are stored under [.guihint]#My Bookmarks#.
