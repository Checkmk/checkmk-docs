:title: Monitoring network services (Active checks) - Monitoring of HTTPS, TCP, SSH, FTP and further services
:description: For many services, it only makes sense to externally monitor them for function or response times. Here you will learn how this works in {CMK}.

== Introduction

In {CMK} you can monitor your infrastructure in many different ways. Monitoring
by means of xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[agents] or xref:snmp#[SNMP] are only two of
xref:wato_monitoringagents#[a number of methods]. What both have in common is that
they only report states as the host sees them from the inside, but you will
probably be aware of some services that can only be monitored effectively from
the outside. Whether the web server is functioning can still be verified from
the inside, but however, the accessibility and response times of the actual user
cannot be determined in this way.

{CMK} provides its _active checks_ for such situations. These checks allow you
to monitor network services directly and conveniently from the outside, and to display
the information in your monitoring. Active checks are small programs or scripts that connect
to a service in the network or the internet, and then provide the user with the
monitoring data. Many of the scripts and programs you will find in {CMK} are
originally from
link:https://www.monitoring-plugins.org[www.monitoring-plugins.org^].
Since {CMK} is generally compatible with Nagios, you can also use all of the
plug-ins that work under Nagios.

When you integrate such plug-ins, keep in mind the main purpose of active checks --
In terms of end-to-end monitoring, they are supposed to check the accessibility, response time, or response status
of a network-accessible service on the monitored host.
{CMK} offers a range of efficient checks for many other monitoring tasks.
You can find an overview in the article
xref:devel_check_plugins.html#real_plug-in[Write your own check plug-ins].

The most important of these programs and scripts are available in {CMK} directly
in the web interface. Here is a small selection:

== Setting up active checks

=== Setting up regular active checks

In the Setup you can -- as already mentioned above -- set up the most important and
most frequently used checks directly in the web interface. To do this, open
[.guihint]#Setup > Services > HTTP, TCP, Email#.
Here you will find the rule sets with which you can set up these checks:

image::active_checks_rulesets.png[]

Most options in the rule sets are self-explanatory. However if something is
unclear you can also refer to the icon:icon_help[] inline help for
explanations of the many options.


=== Assigning active checks to a host

For some rules, it is necessary to specify an IP address or host name in the
options. In many places it is possible to leave this option empty, so that the
host name or the IP is adopted from the hosts for which this rule applies.
In this way you can easily use just one rule to provide a whole group of hosts
with an active check. Therefore always make sure -- also with the aid of the
already-mentioned icon:icon_help[] inline help --
whether this option is available in the specific rule set.
You may thus save yourself a lot of configuration work.

Here is an example using the HTTP check: Let's assume you want to monitor the
validity of the certificates for all of the web servers in your infrastructure,
but do not want to create dozens or even hundreds of rules:

image::active_checks_http_conf.png[]

To accomplish this with a single rule, first think about how best to fill the
[.guihint]#Conditions#. In the following example we use the function of xref:labels#[labels].
In our case, we have previously set the label `webprotocol:https` for all of our web servers.
Using this label we can now create a rule and set the [.guihint]#Conditions# to reference this label:

image::active_checks_http_conditions.png[]

After you have activated the rule you have just created, search in the xref:user_interface#search_monitor[Monitor menu] 
for the service name `Certificate expiry` you just set. In the following example the label has been
set on four hosts. With the [.guihint]#Summary# you can then actually see that several
websites were checked, because the expiration dates of their certificates are slightly
different:

[{image-border}]
image::active_checks_http_services.png[]

*Important*: Note that for active checks, not only the first rule to which
the conditions apply is evaluated, but rather _all rules_ for which the
conditions for a host apply! Only in this way is it possible to set up multiple
services on one host.


[#nagios_plugins]
=== Integrating other Nagios-compatible plug-ins

Not only the active checks which you can find as rule sets in the web interface
are available to you in {CMK} of course. In addition to these check plug-ins,
you will find many more in your site. To simplify the example of an overview shown here,
only selected relevant lines are displayed in the following sample output:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll ~/lib/nagios/plugins/
total 2466
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   56856 Feb  3 00:45 check_dig
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    6396 Feb  3 00:45 check_flexlm
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    6922 Feb  3 00:45 check_ircd
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   60984 Feb  3 00:45 check_ntp_peer
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   78136 Feb  3 00:45 check_snmp
----

Each of these check plug-ins also offers a help option (`-h`),
which allows you to learn more about how to use the respective plug-in without
having to visit the [.guihint]#monitoring-plugins# website.

In [.guihint]#Setup > Services > Other services# {CMK} offers the special rule set [.guihint]#Integrate Nagios plugins#
to make these plug-ins convenient to use. The two most important
options here are the specification of a service description and a command line.
The latter can be written as if you are already in the correct directory:

image::active_checks_custom_config.png[]

Note that the above-mentioned macros, such as `$HOSTNAME$` or
`$HOSTADDRESS$` are also available here. A list of all of the available
macros can be found as always in the icon:icon_help[] inline help. After activating the changes, you can see the new service on the assigned host:

image::active_checks_custom_service01.png[]


==== Using your own plug-ins

In some cases, you will have already written your own plug-ins and now want to
use them in {CMK}. In this case the procedure is largely identical. The only
requirement is that the plug-in is compatible with Nagios. This includes a
single line output with the details of the status and an exit code describing
the status. This must be 0 for {OK}, 1 for {WARN}, 2 for {CRIT} or 3 for
{UNKNOWN}. A short example to illustrate the very simple to understand syntax
can be found here:

./omd/sites/mysite/myscript.sh
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "I am a self written check and I feel well."
exit 0
----

With a single action place the plug-in in the local file path for your site and make it executable:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} install -m755 ~/tmp/myscript.sh ~/local/lib/nagios/plugins/
----

The rest of the procedure is then identical to other plug-ins which are created
via the [.guihint]#Integrate Nagios plugins# rule set, so that you
can see the new service at the end:

image::active_checks_custom_service02.png[]


== Special features of active checks

Services that were created by active checks behave differently in some respects
than other services. So the services of an active check...

* ... continue to be checked even if a host is {DOWN}.
* ... execute independently of other (passive) services. This also allows you to set your own interval.
* ... are always executed by the {CMK} site's server. Exceptions are xref:active_checks#mrpe[MRPEs], which are executed directly on a host.
* ... are not incorporated via xref:wato_services#discovery[service discovery], but are generated automatically.


[#mrpe]
== Running active checks on a host (MRPE)

Suppose you are monitoring a host A (e.g. a web server) from your {CMK} site, which in turn accesses services from host B (e.g. a database).
Monitoring the services on host B directly from the {CMK} site will most likely be corrupted by other packet run times, etc., and therefore will not give any accurate indication of how the accessibility from host A behaves in operation.
Here it is convenient to have a Nagios plug-in run from the agent of the monitored host (here A), which directly checks the services on host B.

To run a classic Nagios plug-in on a host being monitored, we provide _MK's
Remote Plugin Executor_ (abbreviated: MRPE). Depending on whether you want to
run such a plug-in on a unix-type system or on a Windows system, place it in the
appropriate location in the respective agentâ€™s installation directory.
In addition you will need a configuration file that determines how the plug-in
is to be executed, and what the specific command line for the call looks like.

Detailed instructions can be found in the respective articles on
xref:agent_windows#mrpe[Windows] and xref:agent_linux#mrpe[Linux].


== Files and directories

[cols="45,~"]
|===
|File path |Description 

|`~/lib/nagios/plugins/` |Here you will find all plug-ins that are delivered with {CMK}. No distinction is made between plug-ins that are written by link:https://www.monitoring-plugins.org[www.monitoring-plugins.org^] and those that are written specifically for {CMK}.
|`~/local/lib/nagios/plugins/` |You can store your own plug-ins here. They are then dynamically read in, and will also survive an update of the {CMK} site.
