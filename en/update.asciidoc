== Introduction

Updating {CMK} is a bit different than most other software packages that
you may be familiar with. Why is that?

The reason is that {CMK} not only allows multiple independent *sites* to run on a single server, but it also allows multiple
link:cmk_versions.html[software versions] to be installed simultaneously. With
this system each site is assigned to an installed version of the software.
To illustrate, we can take the following situation on a fictional server:

image::update1.png[width=300]

Here the site `mysite1` uses version `2.0.0p3.cee`,
but the sites `mysite2` and `mysite3` use
version `2.0.0p1.cre`. Though {CMK}-Version `2.0.0p1.cfe` is
installed, it is currently not being used.

This example makes it clear that an update does not simply mean the installation
of a new {CMK} RPM/DEB package on a server.
Another additional step is also required. Let us take the following
situation as an example:

image::update2.png[width=300]

Here the site `mysite` is to be updated to the
{CMK}-version `2.0.0p3.cee`. The first step is to download and install
the appropriate RPM/DEB-Packet. This is performed exactly as with the
link:install_packages.html[initial installation]. At first the newly-installed version will
not be used by any site, and it will look like this:

image::update3.png[width=300]

The second step will now be an update of the site from `2.0.0p1.cre`
to `2.0.0p3.cee`. This is achieved with the `omd update` command,
which we will discuss in detail below:

image::update4.png[width=300]

Following the update, the (likely) no longer required version `2.0.0p1.cre`
can be deleted by uninstalling the appropriate package.


[#before_update]
== Before the update

If you are planning to update the {CMK} version {v16} to {v20}, you should first read the xref:update_20#[Update to version 2.0.0] article, in which we have compiled the most important issues you should consider before and after such an update.

But even if you have already installed a {v20} version and want to update to a new stable patch version of {v20}, the topics described in the following sections may be relevant.


[#local_files]
=== Local files

Local files allow you to customise and extend the functionality provided by {CMK}. 
These files are located in the local part of the site directory structure, i.e. in `~/local`. 
Local files can cause problems when updating, as they may no longer match the new {CMK} version.

Since it is not possible for {CMK} to intercept and handle local customisations and any third-party extension during an update, you should check your {CMK} site before an update to see if and which local files you are using.

Get an overview of the local files of your {CMK} site by executing the following command as the site user (where the `-L` option ensures that symbolic links are also followed):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} find -L ~/local -type f
----

In a fresh installation of {CMK}, you will currently only see a file called `README.TXT` listed.
Anything beyond that should be at the top of your troubleshooting list in case you have problems updating.


[#incompatible_mkps]
=== Incompatible and obsolete MKPs

The {CMK} extension packages (MKPs) can be used to extend your monitoring system quite easily and conveniently. 
On the one hand, it happens that such MKPs are no longer maintained and may then no longer be compatible with new versions of {CMK}. 
On the other hand, we keep adding new plug-ins and functional extensions to {CMK}, which is why MKPs sometimes become obsolete. 
Their functionality is simply ensured by {CMK} itself.

If you have installed MKPs, it is urgently recommended to check them.
This will prevent incompatible packages from interfering with the update, or of having duplicate or at least very similar services following the update.

To do this, check your installed MKPs against our link:https://checkmk.com/integrations[Catalog of Check plug-ins] and remove packages which are now provided natively by {CMK}. 
You can also take this opportunity to remove MKPs that may have only been installed for a test run.
You can find a list in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu under [.guihint]#Maintenance > Extension packages#. 
On the command line, with the following commands you can display installed extensions as well as any unpackaged files:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp list
{c-omd} mkp find
----

Should you not be able to assign all packages via the check of the installed MKPs and the comparison with our catalogue, we recommend the link:update_20.html#dry_run[dry run of the update] described below in order to identify incompatibilities and then remove these from your production monitoring before the update.

Check the output of these commands for extensions and files that are no longer needed or that you cannot even allocate. 
To check their impact on the update, you can make copies of these extensions and files and remove them from your {CMK} site, at least temporarily.


[#detailed]
== Updating {CMK}


=== Installing new versions

As described in the introduction, the first step with an update is the
link:install_packages.html[installation] of the desired new link:cmk_versions.html[version] of {CMK}.
This is achieved in exactly the same way as with the initial installation --
it will however proceed somewhat more quickly since most of the dependent packages
have already been installed. In the following example we are installing the
package for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt install /tmp/check-mk-enterprise-2.0.0p3_0.focal_amd64.deb
----

*Note:* When installing a local package via `apt install`, you have to state the pull path to the .deb file.

A list of your installed {CMK} versions can be displayed at any time with the
`omd versions` command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd versions
1.6.0p22.cre
2.0.0p3.cee (default)
2.0.0p2.cre
----

One of these listed versions is marked with `(default)`.
This default version will be used automatically when creating
new sites, as long as no other version is specified with
`omd -V myversion create mysite`. The current default version can be queried with `omd version`,
and it can be altered with `omd setversion`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd version
OMD - Open Monitoring Distribution Version 2.0.0p3.cee
{c-root} omd setversion 2.0.0p2.cre
{c-root} omd version
OMD - Open Monitoring Distribution Version 2.0.0p2.cre
----

The default version plays no role when managing _existing_ sites.
The `omd` command always starts with the version appropriate to the site for which the command is called.

A listing of the current sites and the versions they use is provided
by the `omd sites` command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd sites
SITE             VERSION          COMMENTS
mysite           1.6.0p22.cre
test             2.0.0p3.cee      default version
----


[#execute]
=== Performing the update

Once the desired new version has been installed, the site can be updated.
No `root`-permissions are required for this.
The best way to do this is as a site user:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} su - mysite
----

Ensure that the site has been stopped:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd stop
----

The update -- in effect switching to a different version -- can now simply be
performed with the `omd update` command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd update
----

If more than one target version is available, a selection list will open:

image::update_omd-update-2.png[width=340]

In the following dialogue box, confirm the selected update to the new version:

image::update_omd-update-3.png[width=340]

When updating from a {RE} to the {CSE} you will be reminded of this fact:

image::update_raw_to_enterprise.png[width=210]

An important part of an update is the refreshing of the
originally provided configuration files. Here changes that had possibly
been made to these files by the user will not simply be discarded, rather they
will be merged. This functions very much like version control systems which
attempt to amalgamate changes made to a single file simultaneously by multiple
developers.

Occasionally -- when the changes affect the same location in the file --
that won't function, and a _conflict_ occurs. How you can solve such conflicts
will be explained link:update.html#conflicts[later below].

The update provides a listing of all modified files and directories (shortened in the following example):

[{shell}]
----
2021-04-21 12:53:49 - Updating site 'mysite' from version 1.6.0p18.cre to 2.0.0p3.cee...

[green]#pass:[*]# Updated        .profile
[green]#pass:[*]# Installed dir  var/redis
[green]#pass:[*]# Installed dir  var/check_mk/rrd
[green]#pass:[*]# Installed dir  var/check_mk/reports
 ...

-|  1/15 Migrate deprecated network topology dashlet...
...
-|  15/15 Rename discovered host label files...
-| Done
[green]#pass:[OK]#
Finished update.
----

Once everything has been successfully processed, the site is switched
to the new version:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd version
OMD - Open Monitoring Distribution Version 2.0.0p3.cee
----

&#8230; and can then be started:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd start
----


[#incompatible]
=== Incompatible changes

Software development of course consists of changes. Because we are always actively
working to keep {CMK} modern, sometimes cutting dead weight and making changes
that turn out to be _incompatible_ is unavoidable. That means that when
updating it may _possibly_ be necessary to adapt your configuration,
or you should at least check it.

A typical example of such a situation is with new check plug-ins which replace
existing plug-ins. If you use one of the affected plug-ins, a fresh
link:wato_services.html[service discovery] will be required on the affected host.

An overview of all changes in {CMK}, including a search function,
can be found online in our link:https://checkmk.com/werks[Werks].

Even more practical however is the built-in search function in the release notes. After you have logged in to the site, you will find the link highlighted in red in the [.guihint]#Help# menu:

image::update_help_menu_incompatible_werks.png[width=65%]

{CMK} keeps track of incompatible changes that occurred during the update from the original to the current version and asks you to check and then _acknowledge_ them:

image::update_incomp_werks.png[]

You can call up each 'Werk' individually, view it, confirm it with a mouse click -- and thus successively reduce the number of open incompatible changes. In addition, you can use the [.guihint]#Filter# button to show the filter bar and thus have access to the complete history of changes.


=== The update in detail

Are you curious about what exactly is happening ‘under the hood’ of an
update? Or have data conflicts appeared when `omd update` is running?
If so, here is some further reading.

Three actions take place during `omd update`:

. The refreshing of the default files under `etc/` and `var/` – i.e., files created by `omd create`
. The switching of the active version to the target version by changing the symbolic link `version` which is found in the site directory
. Post-processing by various packages (e.g., {CMK}). In particular, an
xref:wato#activate_changes[Activate Changes] will be automatically executed in order to generate a valid configuration for the core.


==== Updating files, merging changes

The first step is by far the most comprehensive. Here {CMK} demonstrates a
big advantage in comparison to the typical software installation --
{CMK} helps you to adapt all of the standard configuration files to the
prerequisites of the new version. This resembles the procedure for updating a
Linux-Distribution, but goes further in the implementation.
{CMK} can handle a multiplicity of situations, for example:

* The merging of file changes with changes made locally by the user
* Files, directories and symbolic links which are obsolete in the new version, or which have been deleted by the user
* Changes to permissions
* Changes to a file type (a symbolic link derived from a file or directory, or vice versa)
* Changes to the target of a symbolic link

{CMK} always ensures that your local changes are retained, and that all
of the changes required by the new version are simultaneously implemented.

[#conflicts]

==== Merging and conflicts

If the new version intends changing a configuration file on which the user has
also made changes, {CMK} automatically attempts to _merge_ both sets of changes.
This is achieved using the same methods as used by version-control systems.

The fewest problems are experienced when your and {CMK}’s changes have a clear
physical separation in the text (at least a few lines apart). The merge will
then be effected automatically, and without needing the user’s intervention.

If two changes ‘collide’ because they both affect the same location in the data,
{CMK} cannot and will not decide which of the changes is more important.
In such a situation you are switched on as a user and can interactively resolve the conflict:

image::omd-update.png[width=500]

In the situation shown above, you now have the following options:

[cols="5,~"]
|===

|*d* |This shows the differences between the new default version and your version of the file in the form of a ‘unified diff’ (`diff -u`).
|*y* |This is similar to the above, but based on the preceeding default version shows which changes you have made to the file.
|*n* |This third option in effect ‘closes the triangle’ by showing the changes which {CMK} intends making to the file.
|*t* |By selecting *t*, your original file – without the already successfully-merged changes – will be opened in an editor. Now edit the file in order to bypass possible conflicts. Once the editor has been closed {CMK} will reattempt the merge.
|*k* |Here you can decide whether to accept the data ‘as is’. The successfully inserted changes are retained. Apart from this the file remains as customised by the user.
|*r* |With this you can fall back to the old version of your file, and go without {CMK}’s update for this file. Any customisations that may be required must be performed manually.
|*i* |Install the new default file version: your changes in the old file will be lost.
|*s* |If you are uncertain, you can open a shell with *s*. You will find yourself in a directory containing the relevant file, and there can get a picture of the situation. Quit the shell with Strg-D in order to proceed with the update.
|*a* |Abort the update. The site retains the old version. Files that have already been changed during the update however remain changed! A new update attempt can be started at any time.
|===


==== Further conflict situations

Alongside the content-merging of files there is a whole series of further
situations in which {CMK} requires your decisions. Some of these are very
unusual situations, that nevertheless need to be handled correctly.
In these cases {CMK} will always give you the choice of keeping your version,
or of adopting the new default version. What is more, there is always the option
of aborting an update, or of opening a shell.
Examples of such ‘difficult’ situations are:

* conflicting changes to file types (e.g., when a file is replaced by a symbolic link)
* conflicting changes to file permissions
* changed files that are not required by the new sofware version
* files, directories or links created by a user, which conflict with a new version’s files/directories/links


==== Explanation of the output during an update

The update procedure will always output a line of explanation when it makes
a change to a file automatically. The following situations are possible –
files are referred to here, but this also applies analogously to links and directories:

[cols="25,~"]
|===

|Updated |A file has been changed with the new version. Since you have not made a change to the file, {CMK} simply installs the new default version of the file.
|Merged |A file has been changed with the new version, and at the same time the user has made other changes to the file. Both versions of the file can be merged into one without conflict.
|Identical |A file has been changed in the new version, and at the same time the user has already made identical changes to the file. {CMK} must not perform any action.
|Installed |The new version includes a new configuration file which has just now been installed.
|Identical{nbsp}new |The new version includes a file, an identical copy of which the user has already installed.
|Obsolete |The new version has obsoleted a file (also applies to a link or a directory). The user has anyway already deleted it. No action.
|Vanished |Another file is obsolete in the new {CMK}, and the user has neither deleted nor changed the existing version. {CMK} deletes this file automatically.
|Unwanted |The user has deleted a file which is normally present. Because the version in the new {CMK} has no changes from the last version of the file, {CMK} allows the file to be absent.
|Missing |The user has already deleted a file, but in the new {CMK} this file contains changes from the previous version. {CMK} installs the new file, and logs a notification of this action to the user.
|Permissions |{CMK} has updated a file’s permissions because different permissions are set in the new version.
|===


=== Updating without user interaction

Would you like to automate {CMK}’s software updates? You may at first
have difficulties with the interactive responses from `omd update`.
There is a simple solution for this scenario: the command has options that
have been especially conceived for use in scripts:

* The options `-f` or `--force` directly following `omd` inhibit all types of “Are you sure... ?” questions.
* The option `--conflict=` directly following `update` determines the desired behaviour if a file conflict occurs.

Possible values for `--conflict=` are:

[cols="25,~"]
|===

|--conflict=keepold |In the case of a conflict, the user’s own modified version of the file is retained. It is however possible that {CMK} may not be executable, and that manual rectification will be required.
|--conflict=install |In the event of a conflict, the new standard version of the file will be installed. With this, local changes to the file will be at least partly lost.
|--conflict=abort |In the event of a conflict the update is stopped. That does *not* necessarily mean that _everything_ will fall back to the old state. A number of configuration files may have already been updated. The software version will however remain the old version.
|--conflict=ask |This is the standard procedure, so in this form the option is actually superfluous.
|===


Below is an example of the complete command for an automated update
to version `2.0.0p3.cee` of `mysite`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd stop mysite ; omd -f -V 2.0.0p3.cee update --conflict=install mysite && omd start
----

Through the `&amp;&amp;` before `omd start` a restarting of the
site will be prevented if the `omd update` is aborted by an error.
Replace the `&amp;&amp;` with a semicolon (`;`)
if a start should definitely be attempted even in such a situation.


If you are certain that only a single {CMK} site is running on the server,
the name to be used in a shell script can simply be trapped in a variable:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd sites --bare
mysite
{c-root} SITENAME=$(omd sites --bare)
{c-root} echo $SITENAME
mysite
----

This enables the above line to be independent of the site’s name.
For example, a small shell script could look like this:

.update.sh
[{file}]
----
#!/bin/bash
SITE=$(omd sites --bare)
VERSION=2.0.0p3.cee

omd stop $SITE
omd -f -V $VERSION update --conflict=install $SITE  && omd start $SITE
----


[#updatedocker]
== Updating the Docker container

The update of a {CMK} site in the Docker container is very simple.
The following are the only requirements:

* The container is not deleted when the container is stopped -- i.e., the `--rm` option was not used at startup.
* You know the ID of the _volume_ for the container. Normally you should have given its storage a unique ID when you started the container. If you are unsure of your volume’s ID, you can retrieve information about the container named `myContainer` with the xref:managing_docker#commands[command] `docker inspect myContainer`.

If you followed the xref:introduction_docker#[installation guide for {CMK} in Docker]
you should automatically meet the requirements.

The update process is performed in 3 steps:

. Stop the container. If the {CMK} container is called `myContainer`, the command will be: `docker stop myContainer`.
. Remove the container. The command is: `docker rm myContainer`.
. Start a new container with the command `docker container run` with the desired version, and mount the known volume. If your volume is called `myVolume`, the corresponding option is `-v myVolume:/omd/sites`. All options of the command can be found in xref:introduction_docker#[installation guide for {CMK} in Docker].

{CMK} will then automatically do the rest -- updating and starting your {CMK} site.
Afterwards you will be able to log in as usual.


[#updatedemo]
== Upgrading the {FE} to the full version

Was your first installation of {CMK} the {FE}?
Once you have a {SE} or {ME} subscription, you can simply upgrade your existing
sites to the full version.

The procedure is exactly the same as that for a ‘normal’ update.
The only difference is that a version's name with the `.cfe` suffix
is upgraded to a name with the `.cee` suffix.
Simply install the desired package of the full version, and switch the existing
site to this with `omd update`.

This upgrade can be most easily performed if both versions are identical,
apart from the `.cfe` and `.cee` suffixes respectively.
What this means for the functionality is that the {FE} is completely
identical to the full version. Thus an upgrade makes no difference at all.

A simultaneous upgrade with a change of version is however quite possible.
The fundamentals remain valid as for a xref:detailed[normal update of {CMK}].


[#updatecma]
[#upgrade]
=== Upgrading the {CMK} Appliance

You can also upgrade the {FE} appliance to a full version of one of the {EE} without data loss:

. xref:appliance_usage.html#cma_webconf_firmware[Upgrade the firmware] of the appliance via its web interface to the current firmware of the full version.
. xref:appliance_usage.html#manage_cmk[Install the {CMK} software] of the {SE} or the {ME} on the appliance.
. In the xref:appliance_usage.html#site_management[site management] of the appliance, switch the sites to the full version.

[#updateraw]
== Upgrading the {RE} to one of the {EE}

=== Introduction

An upgrade of the {CRE} to one of the {EE} is also possible. Here as well, the
procedure is the same as before: install the desired pacakge, and upgrade
the sites with `omd update`.

Since a number of modules and features of the {EE} are not available in the {RE},
following a changeover there are a couple of points to be aware of.
The key point is that when creating _new_ sites of {RE} or {EE}
_different default settings_ are set.


=== Nagios vs. CMC

Since the {RE} only supports Nagios as its core, this is preinstalled in sites
created by the {RE}. This is retained when an upgrade to the {CSE} is made.
That means that after an upgrade, processing will initially continue with
a Nagios core. A migration to the CMC is performed with `omd config`,
and this precedure will be described in its link:cmc_migration.html[own article].


=== RRD-Format

The {EE} support an alternative format for saving historic performance data,
one which requires significantly less hard drive-I/O. This is preinstalled
in new {EE} sites. {RE} sites will not be changed over automatically
by an upgrade. How the migration can be performed is described in its own
link:graphing.html#rrdformat[chapter] in the article covering
link:graphing.html[Performance data and graphing].


=== Notification spooler

The {RE} has no notification spooler. Thus following the changover to one of the {EE}
it is not active at first. How to activate it can be learned
link:distributed_monitoring.html#activatemknotifyd[here].


== Uninstalling {CMK}

=== Overview

The uninstallation of no longer required {CMK} versions is performed using the
operating system’s package manager. To do this, enter the installed package’s
name – NOT the file name of the original RPM/DEB file. Important: Only delete
{CMK} versions that are no longer being used by any site!

{CMK} sites that are no longer required can simply be removed with `omd rm`
(thereby deleting all data as well!):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd rm mysite
----

=== SLES, RedHat, CentOS

Here is how to identify which {CMK} packages are being used in RPM-based systems:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} rpm -qa | grep check-mk
check-mk-enterprise-2.0.0p3-el8-38.x86_64
check-mk-raw-1.6.0p22-el8-38.x86_64
check-mk-raw-2.0.0p2-el8-38.x86_64
----

The deletion is performed with `rpm -e`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} rpm -e check-mk-raw-1.6.0p22-el8-38.x86_64
----


=== Debian, Ubuntu

Use the below to identify which packets are installed:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} dpkg -l | grep check-mk
ii  check-mk-enterprise-2.0.0p3  0.focal  amd64  Checkmk - Best-in-class infrastructure & application monitoring
ii  check-mk-raw-1.6.0p22        0.focal  amd64  Checkmk - Best-in-class infrastructure & application monitoring
ii  check-mk-raw-2.0.0p2         0.focal  amd64  Checkmk - Best-in-class infrastructure & application monitoring
----

The uninstallation is performed with `dpkg --purge`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} dpkg --purge check-mk-raw-1.6.0p22
(Reading database ... 567850 files and directories currently installed.)
Removing check-mk-raw-1.6.0p22 (0.focal) ...
...
----


[#diagnose]
== Fault Diagnosis

If an error occurs when updating {CMK}, it is usually due to one of the following three causes, which have already been mentioned in the previous chapters:

* The manual intervention required by an xref:incompatible[incompatible change] has not been performed.
* You have installed an xref:incompatible_mkps[incompatible extension package (MKP)].
* There are incompatible scripts in the xref:local_files[local files] of the site directory structure.


== Files and directories

The files and directories relevant to this article can be found here.
As always, paths that do not begin with `‘/’` apply after the site's home
directory (`/omd/sites/mysite`).

[cols="25,~"]
|===
|Path name |Function 

|version |Symbolic link to the installation of the {CMK} version used by this site.
|/omd/versions |In this directory a subdirectory exists for every installed {CMK} version. The files belonging to `root` and are never changed.
|/omd/sites |In this directory, for every site there is a home directory containing its configuration files and variable data. This data belongs to the site’s user, and can be changed by configuration and operations.
|/usr/bin/omd |Management command for {CMK} sites. This is a symbolic link to the default version’s `bin`-directory. When a particular site is accessed the `omd`-command substitutes itself with that of the appropriate version.
|===
