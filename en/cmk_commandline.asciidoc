== Why Command Line?

When a {CMK}-System has been installed, it can be 100% configured and
operated using the web interface. There are nonetheless situations in
which it is useful to dive into the depths of the command line,
for example:

* when searching for the source of problems
* when automating the administration of {CMK}
* when programming and testing your own extensions
* to be able to understand how {CMK} functions internally
* if you simply enjoy working with the command line!


This article will present the most important commands, files and directories
on {CMK}'s command line.


== The instance user

=== Login as instance user

When administering {CMK}, with a few exceptions you need never work
as the `root`-user. In this article we will generally assume that
you are logged in as an _instance user_. That is done with, e.g.:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} su - mysite
----


It is also possible to make a direct SSH-login to an instance without a detour
via `root`. Since the instance user is a ‘completely normal’ Linux user,
you must simply assign a password for this (which
requires `root`-permissions, once only, for the configuration):

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} passwd mysite
Enter new UNIX password: *********
Retype new UNIX password: *********
passwd: password updated successfully
----

Afterwards an SSH-login directly from another computer should be possible
(Windows-users preferably use PuTTY for this). From Linux this login is simply
performed in the command line using the `ssh` command:

[{shell}]
----
user@otherhost> *ssh mysite@mycmkserver*
mysite@localhost's password: *********
----


At the first login a ‘warning’ regarding an unknown host key will probably
be received. When you are certain that in this brief moment no attacker has
taken over your operating system's IP-address, you can simply verify it
with `yes`.

You can also work with the command line on the {CMK}-appliance.
How that is done is explained in its link:cma_ssh.html[own article].


=== Profile and environment variables

So that as few problems as possible arise, particularly as a result of individual
distributions or differing operating system configurations, the {CMK}-system
ensures that the instance user – and likewise all of the monitoring's processes
 – always have a clearly defined environment. Along with the home directory
and the permissions, the *environment variables* (_Environment_) play
an important role.

Among other things, when logging in as an instance user the following variables
will be set or modified. These variables are available for use in all processes
running within the instance. This also applies to scripts that are indirectly
invoked by these processes (for example, a user's own link:notifications.html#scripts[notification scripts]).

[cols=2]
|===

|OMD_SITE |The instance's name (`mysite`). In custom scripts this variable should always be used rather than a hard coded instance name (e.g. with `$OMD_SITE` in the shell). With this the script can also be used unchanged in other instances.
|OMD_ROOT |The path for the instance directory (`/omd/sites/mysite`)
|PATH |Directories in which executable programs will be searched for. For example, {CMK} keeps the instance's `bin/` here. If duplicate names are foundgeschützt {CMK} programs have priority – this is important, e.g., for the `mail` command, a special version of which is provided with a {CMK} installation.
|LD_LIBRARY_PATH |Directories in which additional binary libraries are searched for. Using this variable {CMK} ensures that libraries provided with {CMK} have priority over those installed in the normal operating system.
|PYTHONPATH |Search path for the Python module. {CMK}'s module alternatives have priority here as well.
|PERL5LIB |Search path for the Perl module. The same conditions as for Python apply here.
|LANG |The language setting for command line commands. This setting is adopted from the Linux installation. This variable is automatically deleted in the instance's processes, and the setting reverts to the default English! This also affects other regional settings.  Removing `LANG` is very important, since a number of standard Nagios plug-ins, for example, the German language setting, uses a comma for the decimal separator instead of a point. Your output can thus not be accurately processed.
|===


With the `env` command you can output all of the environment variables
 – adding `|sort` to this command arranges the list a bit more clearly:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} env | sort
HOME=/omd/sites/mysite
LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib:/omd/sites/mysite/lib
LOGNAME=mysite
MAILRC=/omd/sites/mysite/etc/mail.rc
MAIL=/var/mail/mysite
MANPATH=/omd/sites/mysite/share/man:
MODULEBUILDRC=/omd/sites/mysite/.modulebuildrc
MP_STATE_DIRECTORY=/omd/sites/mysite/var/monitoring-plugins
NAGIOS_PLUGIN_STATE_DIRECTORY=/omd/sites/mysite/var/monitoring-plugins
OMD_ROOT=/omd/sites/mysite
OMD_SITE=mysite
PATH=/omd/sites/mysite/lib/perl5/bin:/omd/sites/mysite/local/bin:/omd/sites/mysite/bin:/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/perl5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
PERL5LIB=/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/perl5/lib/perl5:/omd/sites/mysite/lib/perl5/lib/perl5:
PERL_MM_OPT=INSTALL_BASE=/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/perl5/
PWD=/omd/sites/mysite
PYTHONPATH=/omd/sites/mysite/lib/python:/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/python
SHELL=/bin/bash
SHLVL=1
TERM=xterm
USER=mysite
_=/usr/bin/env
----

Under Linux the environment is an attribute of a _process_. Every process
has its own variables, which it automatically passes on to subprocesses.
These start initially with the same, inherited variables, but can also alter them.

With the `env` command you can always only view the the current shell's
environment. If you suspect there is an error in a particular process's
environment, with a small trick you can nonetheless output a listing of its environment.
For this you only need the process-ID (PID).
You can identify this with, e.g., `ps ax`, `pstree -p` or `top`.
With this you can then access the process's `environ` file directly via
the `/proc` file system. Here as an example
is a suitable command for the PID `13222`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} tr \\0 \\n < /proc/13222/environ | sort
----

If you require custom variables for your own scripts or other software to be run
in the instance, store them in the `etc/environment` file which has been
specially created for this purpose. All variables defined here will
be available everywhere within the instance:

.etc/environment
[{file}]
----
# Custom environment variables
#
# Here you can set environment variables. These will
# be set in interactive mode when logging in as site
# user and also when starting the OMD processes with
# omd start.
#
# This file has shell syntax, but without 'export'.
# Better use quotes if your values contain spaces.
#
# Example:
#
# FOO="bar"
# FOO2="With some spaces"
#
*MY_SUPER_VAR=blabla123*
*MY_OTHER_VAR=10.88.112.17*
----


=== Customising the shell and similar actions

If you wish to customise your shell (Prompt or other things), you can perform this as
usual in the `.bashrc` file. Environment variables nonetheless belong to
`etc/environment`, so that they are certain to be available to all processes.

There is also nothing to prevent you having your own `.vimrc` file
if you like working with VIM.


[#folder_structure]
== The directory structure

=== The separation of software and data


The following graphic shows the most important directories in a {CMK}-Installation,
and as an example an instance named `mysite` which uses the {CMK}-Version
`1.4.0p1`:

image::filesystem.png[]

The basis for this structure is provided by the `/omd` directory.
Without exception, all of the files for {CMK} are found here.
`/omd` is in fact a symbolic link to `/opt/omd`, while the actual _physical_
data is located in `/opt` – but all data paths in {CMK} always use `/omd`.

Important is the separation of data (highlighted yellow) and software (blue).
The instance's data is found in `/omd/sites`, and the installed software
in `/omd/versions`.


[#sitedir]
=== The instance directory

Like every Linux user, the instance user also has a home directory,
which we refer to as the instance directory. If your instance is named
`mysite` it will be found in `/omd/sites/mysite`.
As usual in Linux the shell abreviates the its own home directory with a
tilde (`~`) (or swung dash). Since immediately following a login you will
actually be in this directory, the tilde appears automatically in the input prompt:

[{shell}]
----
OMD[mysite]:[hilite]#~#$
----

Subdirectories of the instance directory are shown relative to the tilde:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cd var/log
OMD[mysite]:[hilite]#~/var/log#$
----

A number of subdirectories are located within the instance directory,
these can be listed with `ll`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll
total 16
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   11 Jan 24 11:56 bin -> version/bin/
drwxr-xr-x 19 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 11:56 etc/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   15 Jan 24 11:56 include -> version/include/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   11 Jan 24 11:56 lib -> version/lib/
drwxr-xr-x  5 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 11:56 local/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   13 Jan 24 11:56 share -> version/share/
drwxr-xr-x  2 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 09:57 tmp/
drwxr-xr-x 12 mysite mysite 4096 Jan 24 11:56 var/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mysite mysite   29 Jan 24 11:56 version -> ../../versions/1.4.0p1/
----

As can be seen, the directories `bin`, `lib`,
`include`, `share` and `version` are symbolic links.
The rest are ‘normal’ directories. This mirrors the separation of software and
and data as explained above. The software directory must be accessible as a
subdirectory in the instance, but it is physically located in `/omd/versions`,
and can also possibly be used by other instances.

[cols="20,32,~"]
|===

| |*Software* |*Data*
|Directory |bin include lib share |etc local tmp var
|Owner |`root` |instance user (`mysite`)
|Created by |{CMK} installation |creation of the instance, configuration, and monitoring
|Physical location |`/omd/versions/1.4.0p1/ |`/omd/sites/mysite/
|File type |symbolic links |normal directories
|===



=== The software

The software directories, as usual under Linux, belong to `root`
and thus may not be altered by an instance user. The following subdirectories
are present – those in the example are physically located within the
`/omd/versions/1.4.0p1`, and they are accessible via symbolic links from
the instance directory:

[cols="15,~"]
|===

|bin/ |Directory for executable programs. Here the `cmk` command is found, for example.
|lib/ |C-directories, plug-ins for Apache and Python – and in the `nagios/plugins` subdirectory – standard monitoring plug-ins, which are mostly written in C or Perl.
|share/ |The main part of the installed software. Very many components are located in `share/check_mk` – among others, well over 1,300 Check plug-ins.
|include/ |Contains Include-files for C-programs, which should be linked to libraries in `lib/`. This directory is not important and is only used if you wish to translate C-programs yourself.
|===


The `version/` symbolic link is a ‘intermediate stop’ and serves as a relay
point for the version used by the instance. During a link:update.html[software update] this
will be switched from the old to the new version. Nonetheless, please do not attempt
to perform an link:update.html[update] manually by altering the link, since an update
requires a number of other further steps – which will fail.


[#data]
=== The Data

The actual *data* for an instance is found in the remaining subdirectories
in the instance directory. Without exception, these belong to the instance user.
The instance directory itself is also included. {CMK} stores nothing apart from
the directories listed there. You can create your own files and directories
without problem here, in which tests, downloaded data, copies of log files, etc.
can be kept as desired.


The following directories have been predefined:

[cols=2]
|===

|etc/ |Configuration files. These can be edited either by hand or by using link:wato.html[WATO]. Note: The scripts in `etc/init.d` are actually also ‘configuration’ files, since they are found in `etc/`. This is based on the same pattern as found in every Linux system under `/etc/init.d/`. We do advise against changing this script however, since this can lead to link:update.html#conflicts[conflicts] during a software update. Changes to the scripts are not necessary.
|var/ |Runtime data. All data generated by the monitoring will be stored here. Depending on the number of hosts and services, an immense volume of data can be accumulated – of which the largest part is the performance data recorded in the link:graphing.html#rrds[RRDs].
|tmp/ |Volatile data. {CMK} and other components store temporary data (which does not need to be retained) here. A `tmpfs` is therefore mounted here. This is a file system which manages data in RAM, thus generating zero Disk-IO. Restarting the computer results in the loss of all data in `tmp/`! Stopping and starting the instance does _not_ delete the data.  Data such as sockets, pipes and PID-files can be found in `tmp/run` – these are necessary for communication and managing the server processes.  Do *not* use `tmp/` for storing your own data, since this directory lies im RAM in which space is limited. Store your own data directly in the instance directory, or in your own subdirectory within it.
|local/ |Own extensions. A ‘shadow’ hierarchy of the software directories `bin/`, `lib/` and `share/` can be found in `local/`. These are intended for your own changes or extensions to the software.  Also applicable here: Under no circumstances store test files, log files, security copies or anything else that does not belong there, in `local/`. {CMK} could attempt to execute these files as a part of the software. Likewise, in a distributed monitoring the data will also be duplicated to all slaves.
|===


[#local]
=== Modifying and extending {CMK} – the `local`-hierarchy

As just shown in the above table, the `local` directory with its numerous
subdirectories is intended for your own extensions.
In a new instance, all of the directories in >local/` are initially empty.

With the practical `tree` command you can quickly get an overview of the
structure of `local`.
The `-L 3` option restricts the depth to 3:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} tree -L 3 local
local
|-- bin
|-- lib
|   |-- apache
|   |-- icinga -> nagios
|   |-- nagios
|   |   `-- plugins
|   `-- python
`-- share
    |-- check_mk
    |   |-- agents
    |   |-- alert_handlers
    |   |-- checkman
    |   |-- checks
    |   |-- inventory
    |   |-- mibs
    |   |-- notifications
    |   |-- pnp-rraconf
    |   |-- pnp-templates
    |   |-- reporting
    |   `-- web
    |-- diskspace
    |-- doc
    |   `-- check_mk
    |-- dokuwiki
    |   `-- htdocs
    |-- icinga
    |   `-- htdocs
    |-- nagios
    |   `-- htdocs
    |-- nagvis
    |   `-- htdocs
    `-- snmp
        `-- mibs
----

All of the directories in the _lowest_ level are actively integrated in the software.
A file stored here will be treated in the same way as if it was in the directory with the
same name within `/omd/versions/...` (or respectively, in the logical path from the
instance under `bin`, `lib` or `share`).

Example: In the instance, executable programs will be searched for in `bin`
and in `local/bin`.

Here it applies that in the case of _identical names_ the file in `local`
always has priority. This enables modification of the software without the need
to change installation files in  `/omd/versions/`. The precedure is simple:

. Copy the desired file to the appropriate directory in `local`.
. Modify this file.
. Restart the appropriate service so that the change can take effect.

Regarding point 3 above, if it is not known exactly which service to which the
change applies, simply restart the complete instance with `omd restart`.


[#logs]
=== Log files


In {CMK} – as already-described – the log files are stored in the file directory
link:cmk_commandline.html#data[`var/`].
All components of the relevant log file can be found there:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll -R var/log/
var/log/:
total 48
-rw-r--r-- 1 mysite mysite  759 Sep 21 16:54 alerts.log

Via the [.guihint]#Global Settings# on the web interface the comprehensiveness of
the data to be recorded in the log files can be easily configured:

image::cmk_commandline_logging.png[]

Alternatively it is of course possible to also customise the LogLevel on the
`global.mk` file's command line.
This is in the directory for configuration files.
Specify the entries if they are not already present:

.~/etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/global.mk
[{file}]
----
cmc_log_rrdcreation = None
notification_logging = 1
cmc_log_levels = {
 'cmk.alert'        : 5,
 'cmk.carbon'       : 5,
 'cmk.core'         : 5,
 'cmk.downtime'     : 5,
 'cmk.helper'       : 5,
 'cmk.livestatus'   : 5,
 'cmk.notification' : 5,
 'cmk.rrd'          : 5,
 'cmk.smartping'    : 5,
}
alert_logging = 1
----

The LogLevel increases with the incrementation of the count.
For `notification_log` and `alert_logging` there are two levels (1 and 2),
and for `cmc_log_levels` there are 8 levels (0 to 7). For
`cmc_log_rrdcreation` there are two levels and also the deactivation
('terse', 'full' and None).

The level for the web interface log can be altered as required here:

.~/etc/check_mk/multisite.d/wato/global.mk
[{file}]
----
log_levels = {
 'cmk.web'                : 50,
 'cmk.web.auth'           : 10,
 'cmk.web.bi.compilation' : 30,
 'cmk.web.ldap'           : 20,
}
----

In contrast to the other logs, this LogLevel increases inversely as the count decreases.
The lowest Loglevel is 50, and can be reduced by steps of ten – thus 10 represents the highest LogLevel.

The LogLevel for the Liveproxydaemon is set in the following file.
The syntax is the same as with the web interface log:

.~/etc/check_mk/liveproxyd.d/wato/global.mk
[{file}]
----
liveproxyd_log_levels = {'cmk.liveproxyd': 30}
----

*Important*: Log files can quickly become very large if a high level has been set.
It is generally advisable to use such settings for a 'temporary' customisation,
as an aid in problem identification for example.


== The `cmk` command

Along with the important command link:omd_basics.html[`omd`], which serves for starting
and stopping instances, for the basic configuration of components, and for
link:update.html[software updates], `cmk` is the most important command.
With this a configuration for a monitoring core can be created, checks executed manually,
a service discovery performed, and much more.


=== General options for `cmk`


The `cmk` command is actually an abreviation of `check_mk`,
which was introduced to make typing the command easier. The command includes
a built-in online help, that can as usual be called up with `--help`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --help
WAYS TO CALL:
 cmk [-n] [-v] [-p] HOST [IPADDRESS]  check all services on HOST
 cmk -I [HOST ..]                     discovery - find new services
 cmk -II ...                          renew discovery, drop old services
 cmk -N [HOSTS...]                    output Nagios configuration
 cmk -B                               create configuration for core
...
----

A number of options always work – regardless of the mode with which the command is executed:

[cols="8,~"]
|===

|-v |‘Verbose’: Prompts `cmk` to produce a detailed dump of its current activity
|-vv |‘Very verbose’: the same as the above, with even more details
|--debug |If an error occurs, this option ensures that it will no longer be intercepted, rather the original Python-Exception will be displayed in full. This can be important information for the developer, by showing the exact program location in which the error is located. It will also be very helpful with locating errors in self-written check plug-ins.  If when invoking `cmk` an error is encountered which should be reported to support or feedback, repeat the request with the added `--debug` option, and attach the Python trace to your email.
|===



=== Commands for the monitoring core


The {CEE} utilise the link:cmc.html[CMC] as its monitoring core, the {CRE} uses Nagios.
An important task for the `cmk` is the generation of a configuration file that
is readable for the core, and which contains all of the configured hosts, services,
contacts, contact groups, time periods, etc. On the basis of this information the
core knows which checks are to be executed and which objects it should provide
using the GUI's link:livestatus.html[Livestatus].

For Nagios as well as for the CMC, it is fundamental that the number of hosts,
services and other objects always remains static during the operation,
and that this number can only be altered through the generation of a new configuration,
followed by a reloading of the core. With Nagios a restart of the core is also needed.
The CMC has a very efficient function for the reloading of its configuration
during active processing.


The following table highlights important differences between the configurations of both cores:

[cols="~,53,35"]
|===
| |Nagios |CMC 

|Config. file |etc/nagios/conf.d/check_mk_objects.cfg |var/check_mk/core/config
|File type |Text file with `define`-commands |Compressed and optimised binary file
|Activation |Core restart |Core command for reloading the configuration
|Command |cmk -R |cmk -O
|===


Regenerating the configuration is always necessary if the contents of the
configuration file in `etc/check_mk/conf.d`, or automatically-detected
services in `var/check_mk/autochecks` have been modified.
WATO keeps a record of such changes and highlights them in the GUI.
Should you ‘bypass’ WATO by modifying the configuration manually or with a script,
you will also need to attend to the activation manually.
The following commands serve this function:


[cols="12,12,~"]
|===
|Short |Longform |Function 

|cmk -R |--restart |Generates a new configuration for the core and restarts the core (analogous to `omd restart core`). This is the method provided for Nagios.
|cmk -O |--reload |Generates the configuration for the core and loads this without a restart of the active processing (analogous to `omd reload core`). This is the recommended variant with the CMC.  + +Attention: With Nagios as the core this option still functions, but it can lead to memory holes and other instabilities. Apart from that, this option does in any case not perform a genuine reload, rather it internally stops and restarts the process, as it were.
|cmk -C |--compile |Only useful for Nagios: it generates new versions of the precompiled Python files in `var/check_mk/precompiled`, which greatly accelerates the operation of {CMK} during the monitoring. This procedure is included in `cmk -R`.
|cmk -U |--update |Generates the configuration for the core _without_ activating it. Additionally, in Nagios the action `cmk -C` will be executed automatically.
|cmk -B | |Generates the configuration for the core _without_ activating it. With Nagios as the core, here `cmk -C` will _not_ also be executed.
|cmk -N | |Only Nagios: For diagnostic purposes, this outputs the configuration to be generated on the standard output, without altering the actual configuration file. Here you can enter the host's name simply in order to view the host's configuration (z.B. `cmk -N myserver123`).
|===


To summarise: If you want to customise a {CMK}-configuration und activate
the changes, in Nagios you will subsequently require:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -R
----

And with the CMC:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -O
----


=== Manually executing checks


A second mode in {CMK} deals with the execution of a host's {CMK}-based checks.
With this you can allow all automatically detected, and also manually configured
services, to be immediately checked, without needing to bother yourself with the
monitoring core or the GUI. Simply enter the `cmk` command and the name of
a host configured in the monitoring directly. Furthermore, you should always add
both of the following options:


[cols=2]
|===

|-v |Check results output: Without this option we will only see the output from the {CMK}-service itself, and not the results from the other service.
|-n |Dry run: Results are *not* passed to the core, the performance counter is not updated.
|===

Further tips:

* Do not use this command in monitored production hosts which use Log file monitoring. Log messages are only sent once by agents, and it can happen that a manual `cmk -nv` ‘catches’ these and that they will then be lost from the monitoring. In such a situation use the `--no-tcp` option.
* If Nagios is being used for the core and `-n` is omitted, the effect will be an immediate actualisation of the check results in the core and in the GUI.
* The command is useful when developing your own check plug-ins, because it enables a quicker test than by using the GUI. If the check fails und returns an {UNKNOWN}, the `--debug` option can help to find the problem location in the code.

The following options influence the command:

[cols=2]
|===

|--cache |If the host is already currently being monitored from the core, the host's intended agent data in `tmp/check_mk/cache` will be being used, and the agent will _not_ be contacted. This, for example, avoids the problem with the log files as described above.
|--no-tcp |This is like `--cache`, however it will interrupt with an error if a cache file is absent or not current. Thus in any situation you can suppress an access of the agents.
|--usewalk |For SNMP-hosts: instead of accessing the SNMP-agent this uses a stored SNMP-Walk, that has been predefined with `cmk --snmpwalk myserver123`. These Walks are stored in `var/check_mk/snmpwalks`.
|--checks=df,uptime |Restricts the execution to the check plug-ins `df` and `uptime`. In the case of SNMP-hosts, only the data required for these will be retrieved. This option is practical if you develop your own check plug-ins and only want to test these.
|===


=== Executing a service discovery manually

An automatic service discovery can be started with `cmk -I` or `cmk -II`
on the command line, and by specifying one or more hosts:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -vI myserver123
----

There are two modes for this:

[cols=2]
|===

|cmk -I |Finds and adds missing services.
|cmk -II |Deletes all previously discovered services, and runs a complete new discovery.
|===


All of the applicable details for this theme can be found in the relevant
link:wato_services.html#commandline[chapter]
in the article on the link:wato_services.html[services].


[#utilities]
=== Auxiliary commands

The `cmk` command has a number of modes that are useful generally for
diagnoses and troubleshooting. Here is an overview:


[cols="27,~"]
|===

|cmk -d myserver123 |Retrieves and outputs data from {CMK}-agents.
|cmk -D myserver123 |Display the configurations of host tags, groups and services.
|cmk --paths |Important {CMK} directories: what is located where?
|cmk -X |Check the syntax of configurations in `main.mk` and `etc/check_mk/conf.d`.
|cmk -l |Output the names of all configured hosts.
|cmk --list-tag mytag |Output the names of all configured hosts with the tag `mytag`.
|cmk -L |Output a list of all check plug-ins.
|cmk -m |Open an interactive catalogue of documentation for check plug-ins.
|cmk -M df |Display documentation for the check plug-in `df`.
|===


In the following section we will show how the commands can be used.
The examples are mostly shown in an abreviated form.

==== Retrieving agent output

`cmk -d` retrieves and displays the outputs from a host's {CMK}-agents.
This is not always the same as a `telnet` to Port 6556 in a target host,
since here possible settings for [.guihint]#Datasource programs#, an encryption of the
agent's output and other factors are taken into account. The agent data is thus
retrieved with `cmk -d` in the same way as with the actual monitoring.

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -d myserver123
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.4.0i4
AgentOS: linux
Hostname: Klappfisch
AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
LocalDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local
OnlyFrom:
<<<df>>>
udev              devtmpfs     8155492         4   8155488       1% /dev
tmpfs             tmpfs        1634036      1208   1632828       1% /run
/dev/sda5         ext4       226298268 175047160  39732696      82% /
none              tmpfs              4         0         4       0% /sys/fs/cgroup
----

You can even call up `cmk -d` using the name or IP-Address
of a host that is not installed in the monitoring.
In this case the standard settings for the host will be assumed (i.e.,
TCP-connection to Port 6556, no encrytion, no datasource program).


==== Host configuration overview

For a specified host, `cmk -D` displays the configured services,
host tags and other attributes. Because the list of services is so extensive it
can look somewhat confusing on the terminal. Send the output through
`less -S` to avoid a break:


[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -D myserver123 | less -S

  kernel.util      None              {}
----


==== Path overview for Checkmk


The `cmk --paths` command displays in which directories {CMK} expects
which things. This list does not cover the complete {CMK} system,
rather only those things that the command line tool `cmk` itself works with.
Nonetheless it sometimes helps to locate things more quickly:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --paths
Files copied or created during installation
  Main components of check_mk             : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/modules/
  Checks                                  : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/checks/
  Notification scripts                    : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/notifications/
  Inventory plugins                       : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/inventory/
  Agents for operating systems            : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/agents/
  Documentation files                     : /omd/sites/mysite/share/doc/check_mk/
  Check_MK's web pages                    : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/web/
  Check manpages (for check_mk -M)        : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/checkman/
  Binary plugins (architecture specific)  : /omd/sites/mysite/lib/
  Templates for PNP4Nagios                : /omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/pnp-templates/

Configuration files edited by you
  Directory that contains main.mk         : /omd/sites/mysite/etc/check_mk/
  Directory containing further *.mk files : /omd/sites/mysite/etc/check_mk/conf.d/
----


==== Configuration check


If you manually edit configuration files in `etc/check_mk/`, the configuration
check using `cmk -X` is practical. Not only does it show errors in the Python
syntax, it also identifies incorrectly coded or undefined variables:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -X
Invalid configuration variable 'foo'
--> Found 1 invalid variables
If you use own helper variables, please prefix them with _.
----


==== Output configured hosts


The `cmk -l` command simply lists the names of all configured hosts:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -l
myserver123
myserver124
myserver125
----

Because the data is provided ‘naked’ and ‘unprocessed’, it is easy to use
in scripts – for example a loop across all host names can be easily constructed:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} for host in $(cmk -l) ; do echo "Host: $host" ; done
Host: myserver123
Host: myserver124
Host: myserver125
----

If, instead of `echo` you insert a command that performs something
meaningful, this can be really useful.

The `cmk --list-tag` invocation likewise outputs host names, but also offers
the possibility of filtering by link:wato_rules.html#hosttags[host tags]. Simply enter a
host tag and you will receive all hosts having this tag. The following example lists
all hosts that are monitored by SNMP:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --list-tag snmp
myswitch01
myswitch02
myswitch03
----

Enter multiple tags and they will be linked with ‘and’. The below delivers all hosts
that are monitored by both SNMP *and* normal agents:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk --list-tag snmp tcp
----


==== Overview of the Check plug-ins

{CMK} provides a large number of ready to use plug-ins as standard.
In every release a few new ones are added, and Version 1.4.0 already includes
around 1,300 plug-ins. Three of the call types give access to the list of available plug-ins.
At the same time, any self-written plug-ins stored in `local/` will also be listed.

`cmk -L` produces a table of all plug-ins with their name, type and a description.
The following are possible types:

[cols="15,15"]
|===

|tcp |Evaluates the data from a {CMK}-agent. This is (normally) retrieved via TCP Port 6556 – hence the abreviation.
|snmp |Serves the monitoring of devices via SNMP.
|active |Calls a standard type of Nagios-compatible plug-in for the monitoring. Here {CMK} actually only adopts the configuration.
|===


The list can of course be filtered simply with `grep` if something specific is
being searched for:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -L | grep f5
f5_bigip_chassis_temp     snmp  F5 Big-IP: Chassis temperature
f5_bigip_cluster          snmp  F5 Big-IP: Cluster state, up to firmware version 10
f5_bigip_cluster_status   snmp  F5 Big-IP: active/active or passive/active cluster status
f5_bigip_cluster_v11      snmp  F5 Big-IP: Cluster state for firmware version >= 11
f5_bigip_conns            snmp  F5 Big-IP: number of current connections
f5_bigip_cpu_temp         snmp  F5 Big-IP: CPU temperature
f5_bigip_fans             snmp  F5 Big-IP: System fans
f5_bigip_interfaces       snmp  F5 Big-IP: Special Network Interfaces
f5_bigip_pool             snmp  F5 Big-IP: Load Balancing Pools
f5_bigip_psu              snmp  F5 Big-IP: Power Supplies
f5_bigip_snat             snmp  F5 Big-IP: Source NAT
f5_bigip_vserver          snmp  F5 Big-IP: Virtual servers
----

If you want more information on the plug-ins, documentation can be called up with `cmk -M`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -M f5_bigip_pool
----

This produces the following output:

image::check_manpage_example.png[]

Using `cmk -m` with no further options will access a complete catalogue
of all Check-Manpages.

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -m
----


You can navigate interactively in this catalogue:

image::manpage_catalog_level1.png[align=center, width=400]
image::manpage_catalog_level2.png[align=center, width=400]


[#config]
== Configuration without WATO


=== Where is the documentation?

link:wato.html[WATO] is a great web-based configuration tool. There are however many reasons
to prefer a configuration with text data in the good, old Linux tradition.
If you are of the same opinion there is some good news:
{CMK} can be completely configured using text data. And since WATO does no more
than process (this same) text data, this is not even an either/or situation.

If you are expecting a comprehensive compendium covering the exact structure
of all of the configuration files used by {CMK}, we will unfortunately
have to disappoint you here. The complexity and diversity contained in the
configuration files is simply too much to describe completely in a handbook.

The following example shows an entire completed parameter set for the Check plug-in
which monitors file systems in {CMK}. Because of the many parameters, the
screenshot is divided into four parts, and set in lower-case characters:

image::parameters_for_df_check.png[]

The corresponding passage in the configuration file looks like this (somewhat
more nicely formatted):

.
[{file}]
----
{ 'inodes_levels'      : (10.0, 5.0),
  'levels'             : (80.0, 90.0),
  'levels_low'         : (50.0, 60.0),
  'magic'              : 0.8,
  'magic_normsize'     : 20,
  'show_inodes'        : 'onlow',
  'show_levels'        : 'onmagic',
  'show_reserved'      : True,
  'trend_mb'           : (100, 200),
  'trend_perc'         : (5.0, 10.0),
  'trend_perfdata'     : True,
  'trend_range'        : 24,
  'trend_showtimeleft' : True,
  'trend_timeleft'     : (12, 6)},
----


As can be seen, here there are no fewer than 14 different parameters, each with
its own individual logic. Some are configured using floating-point numbers,
(`0.8`), some with integers (`24`), some with
keywords (`'onlow'`), some with boolean values (`True`),
and others using tuples to code various combinations of these (`(5.0,
10.0)`).

This is just one example from over 1,000 plug-ins. And there are of course
other configurations possible as check parameters: One only needs to think
of time periods, event console rules, user profiles, and many more.

Of course that doesn't mean you cannot use text data to generate a configuration!
If you don't yet know the exact syntax for your chosen configuration task,
you only need the correct tool for it – and this tool we call *WATO*:

. Create a {CMK} test instance.
. Use WATO to configure the desired parameters in the instance.
. Search for the processed configuration files using WATO (more on this below).
. Carry over the exact syntax from the relevant section of this file in your production system.

You thus only need to know in which file WATO writes.


=== Which file is correct?

There is a practical command for finding out which file WATO has
just changed: `find`. By invoking ‘find’ with the following paramters
you can find all files (`-type f`) under `etc/` which have
been altered within the last minute (`-mmin -1`):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} find etc/ -mmin -1 -type f
etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/rules.mk
----

The basis of a configuration is always the `etc/check_mk` directory.
Below this is a subdivision into various domains, which generally apply to
a specific service.
At the same time each has a directory with the suffix `.d`,
under which all files with the suffix `.mk` will be read automatically
in _alphabetic order_.
In some there will also be a main file which is read first of all.
This is intended only for manual alteration, and is never modified by WATO.


[cols="~,~,~,30"]
|===
|Domain |Directory |Main file |Changes aktivated 

|Monitoring |conf.d/ |main.mk |`cmk -O`, bzw. `cmk -R`
|link:user_interface.html[GUI] |multisite.d/ |multisite.mk |_automatically_
|link:ec.html[Event Console] |mkeventd.d/ |mkeventd.mk |omd reload mkeventd
|link:notifications.html#async[notification spooler] |mknotifyd.d/ | |_automatically_
|===



=== Working with WATO

The `wato` subdirectory is always found under the `conf.d/`-directory,
e.g., `etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato`.
WATO fundamentally only reads and writes here.
The actual service reads the remaining files from `conf.d`
if you have stored some manually-created files there. This means:

* If it is required that the manual configuration be visible and editable in WATO, use identical data paths as used in WATO.
* If it is required that the configuration simply functions, but is not visible in WATO, then use your own files externally to `WATO/`.
* If it is required that the configuration be visible in WATO, but not changeable, some of the files can be _locked_.


==== Locking WATO files

A common reason for generating configuration files without WATO is needing to import
hosts to be monitored from a CMDB.
Here, in contrast to methods using the link:web_api.html[Web-API], with a script you
directly generate the folder for the hosts and its included `hosts.mk` file,
and optionally the `.wato` file which contains the folder's attributes.

If this import is not just a one-off, rather it is to be repeated regularly
because the CMDB is the leading system, it would be very impractical if your
users make any changes to the files using WATO, as these will be lost with the
next export.

A `hosts.mk`-file can be locked by including the following line:

.hosts.mk
[{file}]
----
# Created by WATO
# encoding: utf-8

[hilite]#_lock = True#
----

A user attempting to access the relevant folder in WATO will receive this response:

image::hosts_are_locked.png[]

All actions which would alter the `hosts.mk` file are thus locked in the GUI.
This does _not_ apply to the service discovery of course. A host's configured
services are stored in `var/check_mk/autochecks/`.

The folder attributes can also be locked.
This is achieved with an entry in `dict` in the folder's `.wato` file:

..wato
[{file}]
----
{'attributes': {},
 'lock': [hilite]#True#,
 'lock_subfolders': False,
 'num_hosts': 1,
 'title': u'Main Directory'}
----

Also set the `lock_subfolders` attribute, so that the creation and
deletion of subfolders is also prevented.

Locking of other files – such as `rules.mk`, for example – is not currently possible.



=== The files syntax


In purely formal terms, all of {CMK}'s configuration files are written
in *Python 2* syntax. There are two types of files:

* Those which are _executed_ like a script by Python. Among these is, e.g., `hosts.mk`.
* Those which are read in as values by Python. Among these is, e.g., `.wato`.

The executable files can be recognised by their having variables which are substituted
for assignments with values (`=`). The other files usually contain a
Python-Dictionary which begin with an opening bracket '{'. Sometimes they are simple values.

If a non-ASCII character is required in a file (a German Umlaut (ä, ö, ü), for example),
the following comment must be coded in the first or second line:

.somefile.mk
[{file}]
----
# encoding: utf-8
----

A syntax error will otherwise occur when reading the file. For further tips on Python syntax
we recommend visiting a specialist site, for example:
link:https://docs.python.org/2/reference/[The Python Language Reference].
