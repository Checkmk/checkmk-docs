[#intro]
== Introduction


In addition to the classical monitoring -- i.e. the monitoring of status,
log and measurement data -- {CMK} includes
another completely different function virtually free of charge:
the _Hardware/Software Inventory_ (or _HW/SW Inventory_ for short).
This can automatically identify elements on your hosts, such as, for example:

* Which software packages -- and which versions of these -- are installed on a server?
* What kind of RAM components does a server have?
* Which BIOS version is installed on the motherboard?
* The serial numbers of the installed hard disks.
* Whether any ports on a switch not been used for a while (and which are thus probably free)?
* ... and much more

The data obtained in this way are displayed per host in a structured tree,
and in various other views, and are also available via an API.
Here is a small example of inventorying ORACLE databases:

image::inventory_intro.png[]

With the _Hardware/Software Inventory_ you can perform a variety of tasks,
such as:

* Provide data about installed software for a license management system
* Determine type designations for spare parts orders (RAM, hard disks, fans)
* Provide general hardware and software data for regular import into CMDBs, so that these are based on current data
* Track changes to hardware or software, e.g., to determine when a specific BIOS update was performed
* Be alerted if something has changed in the hardware or software
* To identify servers that have not yet had a specific service pack installed

The most important advantage over other comparable systems is obvious -- you
can simply use the existing infrastructure of {CMK} and save yourself the effort of
rolling out and administering another software environment.
You just roll out a single additional agent plug-in.
This is not even necessary with SNMP devices because the inventory scanner also
supports SNMP and simply fetches the data over this route.

And besides, CMK does not need to hide behind other inventory scanners.
As with our check plug-ins, we are constantly working to expand the data
scanning.
Each {CMK} version brings new plug-ins for the inventory scanner,
and the information that can be collected is becoming more detailed and
extensive.


[#config]
== Installation

Installing the HW/SW Inventory is performed in two steps. The prerequisite is
that the {CMK} agent is already installed on the hosts (if they are not monitored via SNMP):

. Switch on inventory for the desired hosts
. Roll out the Inventory plug-in on these hosts


[#activate]
=== Activating the inventory for the desired host(s)


==== Creating the rule

As always, if you want to configure something for specific hosts this is also
possible with the help of a link:wato_rules.html[rule]. This rule can be found under
[.guihint]#WATO > Host & Service Parameters > Hardware/Software Inventory > Do hardware/software inventory#.
Of course it is even easier using the rule search with the word
`inventory` (please do not confuse this with the
[.guihint]#Hardware/Software Inventory (Linux, Windows, Solaris, AIX) set of rules#,
which is for the agent plug-in, as we’ll see later).
Create a new rule for the hosts for which you want to activate the inventory.
There you will find several settings:

image::inventory_rule_value.png[]

For now simply leave everything as preset. The various options that you will
see here are discussed below.

The rule you have just created will generate an
link:wato_services.html#active_checks[active check] for each host at the
next ‘Activate Changes’ that collects all of the inventory data for that
host -- be it from the data that is received from normal {CMK} agents, or through additional SNMP queries.
The new service can be found on the hosts in the service list, and it looks
something like this:

image::inventory_service.png[]

Please do not be concerned that the check found only one item -- this is
because we have not rolled out the plug-in yet.


==== Defining the interval

Inventory data is something that rarely changes, and recognizing a change is
usually not time-critical anyway.
Because of this it makes sense to adjust the interval during which the
inventory check is performed rather than simply
using the usual one-minute interval -- mainly because the processing of the
inventory data in the active check
requires significantly more computing time than that for a normal service.

{CMK} instances that you have created with version {v14} or later
_automatically_ have a rule in the
[.guihint]#Monitoring Configuration > Normal check interval for service checks# set of
rules which sets the interval to one day
for all services with the name [.guihint]#Check_MK HW/SW Inventory#:

image::inventory_check_intervall.png[]

*Important:* If you do not find this rule, please create one yourself,
otherwise the check will be performed once a minute and will require
unnecessary processing time on your {CMK} system.

Of course if you find once a day insufficient, you can also adjust this rule --
e.g., to four or eight hours.
Naturally there is also always the option of setting it differently using
multiple rules for different hosts.


=== Rolling out the Inventory Plug-in on these hosts


The most important step is to install the agent plug-in for the inventory on
the relevant hosts.
You can do this either manually or with the link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent Bakery] (only {EE}).


==== Manual installation

For a manual installation you first need the plug-in.
This can be found in the {EE} on the [.guihint]#WATO > Monitoring Agents > Agent Files#
page, and in the {RE} directly under [.guihint]#WATO > Monitoring Agents#.
Depending on the operating system, use one of the following plug-ins:

[cols="~,40,35"]
|===
|Operating system |Box |Plug-in 

|Windows |[.guihint]#Windows Agent - Plug-ins# |mk_inventory.vbs
|Linux |[.guihint]#Linux/Unix Agents - Plug-ins# |mk_inventory.linux
|AIX |[.guihint]#Linux/Unix Agents - Plug-ins# |mk_inventory.aix
|Solaris |[.guihint]#Linux/Unix Agents - Plug-ins# |mk_inventory.solaris
|===


You can also find these files on the command line in the {CMK} instance in the
`share/check_mk/agents/plugins` (Linux/Unix) subdirectory, or in
`share/check_mk/agents/windows/plugins` (Windows).

Copy the plug-in to the destination hosts in the correct directory for plug-ins.
For the Windows Agent version {v16} it is
`C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins`.
For details see the link:agent_windows.html#plugins[Windows Agent article].

For Linux and Unix the directory is `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins`.
Please make sure that the file is executable (`chmod +x ...`). For
details see the link:agent_linux.html#plugins[Linux Agent articles].

The important thing is that the agent is called by CMK, usually once a minute.
The inventory plug-in, however, requires more processing time than normal
plug-ins because,
for example, it must search for installed software in many directories. It also
generates significantly larger amounts of data.
This is why it has been designed to only generate and deliver new data every
four hours (14400 seconds).

So if for some important reason you have set a _shorter_ interval than
four hours for your inventory check,
you will only actually get new data every four hours.
If you really want to collect more data, in such a case you will need to adjust
the default calculation interval.

For Windows replace the number directly in the plug-in. Search for the number
`14400` and replace it with a different number of seconds.
The location where this is found looks like this (detail):

.mk_inventory.vbs
[{file}]
----
Dim delay
Dim exePaths
Dim regPaths

'These three lines are set in the agent bakery
delay = 14400
exePaths = Array("")
regPaths =
Array("Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall","Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall")
----

With Linux and Unix this is a bit different. For this purpose create a
configuration file `/etc/check_mk/mk_inventory.cfg` with
the following line (here in the example with 7200 seconds):

./etc/check_mk/mk_inventory.cfg
[{file}]
----
INVENTORY_INTERVAL=7200
----

One more note: The inventory plug-in _itself_ dictates that it runs only
every four hours.
Therefore *do not use* the mechanism from the agent for asynchronously
running plug-ins at longer intervals.
Install the plug-in in the simple usual way for direct execution.


==== Configuration using the Agent Bakery

{cee-only}
Of course if you use the link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent Bakery] to
configure your agents, things are much more straightforward.
There is only one rule set independent of the operating system.
This rule set controls the rolling-out of the necessary plug-in as well as its
configuration.
It can be found at [.guihint]#WATO > Monitoring Agents > Rules > Hardware/Software Inventory (Linux, Windows, Solaris, AIX)#:

image::inventory_plugin_rule.png[]

In addition to the interval you can also specify paths for Windows in which to
search for executable `.EXE` files when it comes to finding the software
installed on the system.
You can also configure the paths in the Windows registry,
which should be taken into account as an indicator for installed software.

=== Testing

If you have rolled out the plug-in correctly, you must find significantly more
records the next time you run the host’s inventory check.
The result will then look like this:

image::inventory_service_full.png[]



[#operating]
== Working with the inventory data


=== Tree-structured display

The hosts’ inventory data is displayed on the one hand in a tree-structured
display per host,
and on the other hand in table-form.
The tree can be reached in different ways. If you are in a host view (for
example, [.guihint]#Services of Host ...#), at the top of the view in a menu of buttons
you will also find a button labelled icon:icon_inv[] [.guihint]#Inventory#.

[{image-border}]
image::inventory_contextbutton.png[]

Alternatively, go to the [.guihint]#Check_MK HW/SW Inventory# service, and from there
to the icon:icon_menu[] menu icon,
and then to icon:icon_inv[] [.guihint]#Show Hardware/Software Inventory of this host#:

image::inventory_menu_button.png[]

The same menu item can also be found in the icon:icon_menu[] menu of the
host itself,
which you will find in views that list hosts rather than services.

In all three cases you end up with the tree view of the host’s inventory data.
Starting from the three basic categories icon:icon_hardware[] [.guihint]#Hardware#,
icon:icon_networking[] [.guihint]#Networking#
and icon:icon_software[] [.guihint]#Software#, you can expand and collapse the
tree’s sub-branches:

[{image-border}]
image::inventory_tree.png[]

=== Tabular displays

Many of the inventory data are individual values under very specific paths in
the tree, e.g. the [.guihint]#Hardware > System > Manufacturer > Apple Inc.# entry. But there
are also places in the tree with tables of similar objects. A very important
one is, e.g. the [.guihint]#icon:icon_software[] Software > icon:icon_packages[] Packages# table:

image::inventory_software_packages.png[]

You can find the table of all the software packages installed on the host by
clicking the [.guihint]#Open this table for filtering/sorting# link in the upper right
corner. This additionally shows you that this table also exists as a
link:views.html[view] -- with the usual options such as filtering and sorting. The
important thing here is that this view gives you the ability to search in the
data (e.g., software packages) from _all_ hosts, not just one.

You can as usual access the filters with the icon:icon_filter[] icon:

[{image-border}]
image::inventory_software_search.png[]

If you came here via the link above, then the corresponding hostname is already
listed in the [.guihint]#hostname (exact match)# filter. If you remove this, you can
search for all hosts in your monitoring.

All table-like inventory views can also be found via the [.guihint]#Views# element in
the sidebar under the [.guihint]#Inventory# entry. Those views which begin with the
word [.guihint]#Search# do not submit data until you press the [.guihint]#Search# button (after
you may have filled in some of the filters).

Please note that many general filters to the hosts are not available by default
in the views. These are obtained when you edit the view and add additional host
filters.

Further things you can do with the views:

* Include in link:reporting.html[reports]
* Export as PDF or as CSV
* Integrate with link:dashboards.html[dashboards]

Incidentally, you can also include such inventory data in views that are
_not_ table-like. There is a column type for each well-known path in the
inventory tree, which you can add to views of hosts. An example of this is the
predefined example view [.guihint]#CPU Related Inventory of all Hosts#. This is a table
of hosts that displays additional data from the inventory per host. Here is an
example of one of the column definitions that adds a column to the number of
physical CPUs of the host:

[{image-border}]
image::inventory_view_column.png[width=60%]


[#history]
== Inventory data history

Once you have set up the HW/SW inventory for a host, CMK will record every
change in the inventory data and also store its history. You can find these
histories from a hostview using the icon:icon_inv[] [.guihint]#Inventory History#
button:

[{image-border}]
image::inventory_contextbutton_2.png[]

Here is an excerpt from a history. In the table of installed software packages
you can see how a software update on a Linux system changed the version numbers
of several installed packages. Unchanged data is not displayed here:

image::inventory_software_history.png[]

If you want you can be alerted whenever a change in software or hardware
occurs. This is done via the status of the service [.guihint]#Check_MK HW/SW Inventory#.
To do this edit the rule that you created at the very beginning of
this article (in the [.guihint]#Do hardware/software inventory# ruleset). There in the
value of the rule you will find a number of settings that affect the history.
The following example sets up the service {WARN} if changes occur in software
or hardware:

image::inventory_warn_on_changes.png[]

The next time the inventory check detects changes, it will go to {WARN}. It
will then look like this:

image::inventory_software_changes.png[]

At the next execution of the check, and if in the meantime nothing has changed,
this resets automatically to {OK}. By manually triggering the execution you
also have a way to manually reset the service to {OK} if you do not want to
wait for the next normal periodic execution.


[#statusdata]
== Status data

The tree of inventory data can be automatically updated with the latest
suitable status data. This is very useful in some cases. An example of this is
the ORACLE tablespaces. The actual inventory data contains only relatively
static things like the SID, the name and the type. Current status data can
supplement this with information on the current size, free space, etc.

If you want status data in your tree (and there's nothing wrong with that), you
really do not have to do anything more because usually -- in those which you
created in the beginning under [.guihint]#Do hardware/software inventory# -- this is by
default automatically enabled:

image::inventory_rule_value.png[]

If you have not actively removed the ‘x’ in the [.guihint]#Status data inventory#
checkbox, or have changed the setting there, you will also receive status data.
By the way, a change in the status data will _not_ precipitate changes in
the link:inventory.html#history[history]! This would almost always lead to constant
changes and render this function useless.



[#external]
== External access to the data


=== Access via Web-API

You can export a host’s HW/SW inventory data through a Web API. The URL to it
is `host_inv_api.py?host=` including the desired hostname. Example:

`http://mycmkserver01/mysite/check_mk/host_inv_api.py?host=myhost123`

The output format in this case is Python source code. If you prefer JSON, just
append a `&output_format=json` to it:

`http://mycmkserver01/mysite/check_mk/host_inv_api.py?host=myhost123&output_format=json`

The result will look something like this:

.myhost123.json
[{file}]
----
{
    "result": {
        "hardware": {
            "chassis": {
                "manufacturer": "Apple Inc.",
                "type": "Notebook"
            },
            "cpu": {
                "arch": "x86_64",
                "cache_size": 6291456,
                "cores": 4,
                "cores_per_cpu": 4,
                "cpus": 1,
                "max_speed": 2500000000.0,
                "model": "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4870HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz",
                "threads": 8,
                "threads_per_cpu": 8,
                "vendor": "intel",
                "voltage": 1.1
            },
... usw...

    },
    "result_code": 0
}
----

If you enter the URL in the line of your browser, this will work immediately
because you are already logged in to {CMK} there. From a script the best way to
authenticate is to use link:wato_user.html#automation[Automation-User].


=== Access via a file

Alternatively, you can simply read the files that CMK generates itself. These
files are in python format and are located in the
`var/check_mk/inventory` directory. For each host there is a file in an
uncompressed version (for example, `myhost123`), and a compressed
version (for example, `myhost123.gz`).



[#distributed]
== Inventories in distributed environments

{cee-only}
On the {EE} HW/SW inventory also works in
link:distributed_monitoring.html[distributed environments]. Here the inventory data are
first determined by the local instances and stored there locally under
`var/check_mk/inventory`. link:inventory.html#statusdata[Status data] are not
stored in files, but like the results of checks are held directly in the main
memory of the monitoring kernel.

The link:distributed_monitoring.html#livestatusproxy[livestatus proxy daemon] will
periodically transfer all updated inventory data from the remote site to the
central site, and also store it under `var/check_mk/inventory`. This is
important because this data is too large to pick up live when queried at this
moment.

As soon as the central instance makes queries about inventory data, these files
are read and then merged with current status data, which is then retrieved from
the remote instances via link:livestatus.html[livestatus].

In short -- you do not have to worry about anything.

{cre-only}
There is no live status proxy in the {RE}. Therefore the HW/SW inventory
in the central GUI is incomplete and shows only the status data. You can do
this by regularly transferring the files in the `var/check_mk/inventory`
directory to the central site with a script or the like. It is sufficient to
copy the files _without_ the `.gz` file extension. For efficient
data transmission `rsync`, for example, is suitable.
