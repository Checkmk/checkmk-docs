== Introduction


=== Events are not states

So far in this handbook it has always been a matter of the active monitoring of _States_.
Every monitored service will always have one of the states {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN}.
Through regular polling the monitoring continuously updates its picture of the current situation.

A quite different type of monitoring is that of working with _Events_.
An example of an event is an ‘Exception’ that occurs in an application.
The application may possibly continue running correctly and still have the ‘OK’
state as before – but _something has happened_.

=== The event console

With its *Event Console* (EC) {CMK} has a fully-integrated system for
the monitoring of events from sources such as Syslog, SNMP Traps, Windows Event Logs,
Log Files and user's applications.
With this, not only are events simply used to generate states – they form their
own category, and from {CMK} Version VERSION[1.4.0i2] are even
included in the [.guihint]#Tactical Overview# display.

image::tactical_overview_events.png[align=center, width=280]

Internally, events are not processed by the monitoring core, but rather by their
own service – the Event Daemon (`mkeventd`).

The Event Console has an archive in which it can research past events.
However, this is no substitute for a real log archive.
The Event Console's task is to intelligently filter a _limited_ number
of _relevant_ messages from a large stream. It is optimised for simplicity,
robustness and throughput – not for the storage of large data volumes.

Here are a few facts concerning the EC:

* It can receive messages _directly_ per Syslog or SNMP. A configuration of the corresponding Linux system service is thus unnecessary.
* With the aid of the {CMK}-Agents it can also evaluate text-based log files and Windows Event Logs.
* It classifies messages according to a chain of user-defined rules.
* It can correlate, combine, count, annotate and transcribe messages, and also take their chronological contexts into account.
*  It can execute automated actions and send notifications over {CMK} link:notifications.html[Notifications].
*  It is fully integrated into {CMK}'s interface.
*  It is included with every current {CMK}-System and ready for immediate use.



=== Terms and definitions

The Event Console receives *Messages*. A message is a line of text with a sequence
of possible additional attributes – for example, a time stamp, a host name, etc.
If the message is relevant an *Event* with the same attributes will
be directly generated from it, but:

* An event will be created from a message only if an applicable rule exists.
* Rules can alter the text and other attributes of messages.
* Multiple messages can be combined into an event.
* Messages can link:ec.html#cancelling[cancel] current events.
* 'Artificial' events can be created if particular messages link:ec.html#expect[do not] come.

An event can process through several *Phases*:

[cols="17"]
|===
|open 

|The problem has been acknowledged – this is analogue to host and service problems in status-based monitoring.
|The required count of particular messages has not been reached – the situation is unproblematic. The event will thus not (yet) be reported to the operator.
|An error message has been received, but the Event Console is waiting on an OK-message being received within a defined time. The event will be reported to the operator after this time has expired.
|The event has been closed by the operator, or automatically, and is now only in the archive.
|===


In addition, an event has a *State*. To be precise, here the state of the event
itself is not meant, rather it applies to the service or device that sent the message.
Analogous to status-based monitoring, an event will be classified as {OK}, {WARN},
{CRIT} or {UNKNOWN}.


[#setup]
== Setting up the Event Console

Setting up the Event Console is very simple. In fact no initial extra
configuration is required since from Version VERSION[1.2.8]
of {CMK} the Event Console is always automatically active.

If you nevertheless want to receive Syslog messages or SNMP-Traps
over the network, you must activate these separately.
The reason for this is that both services respectively need to open a UDP-Port
with a specifically nominated port number. Since only one {CMK}-Instance
can do this per system, reception via the network is deactivated by default.
The port numbers are:

[cols=3]
|===
|Protocol |Port |Service 

|UDP |162 |SNMP Traps
|UDP |514 |Syslog
|TCP |514 |Syslog via TCP
|===


Syslog via TCP is only rarely used, but it has the advantage that the transmission
of messages is assured. With UDP it is never garanteed that packets really arrive.
And neither Syslog nor SNMP Traps provide acknowledgements or a similar protection
against lost messages. In order that you can use Syslog via TCP, the sending
system must of course be also capable of sending messages over this port.

In the {CMK}-Appliance you can activate the reception of Sylog/SNMP-Traps in
the instance configuration. Otherwise simply use `omd config`.
The required setting may be found under [.guihint]#Addons#:

image::ec_omd_config.png[align=center, width=300]

In `omd start` it can be seen which external interface your EC has open:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd start
Starting mkeventd (builtin: [hilite]#syslog-udp,snmptrap#)...OK
Starting Livestatus Proxy-Daemon...OK
Starting mknotifyd...OK
Starting rrdcached...OK
Starting Check_MK Micro Core...OK
Starting dedicated Apache for site stable...OK
Initializing Crontab...OK
----



== First steps with the Event Console

[#first_steps_rules]
=== Rules, rules, rules

At the beginning it was mentioned that the EC serves to ‘fish out’ _relevant_
messages and to issue notifications. It is unfortunately the case that most
messages – regardless of whether they come from Text files, the Windows Event Log
or the Syslog – are pretty unimportant. It is also not much help when messages
have already been classified by their source.

To illustrate: in Syslog and in the Windows Eventlog messages are classified
in a similar way to OK, WARN und CRIT. But what WARN and CRIT actually mean
has been subjectively decided by the respective programmer. And it is not
even clear whether the application producing the message is even important
on this computer. In short: there is no alternative but to define your own
configuration of which messages represent a problem for you, and which can
simply be discarded.

As usual in {CMK} the configuration is achieved using _rules_,
which for every incoming EC message will be processed according to the
‘first match’-principle. The first rule that is applicable to an incoming
message decides the messages's fate. If no rule is applicable the message
will simply be silently discarded.

Since over time and under the conditions a large number of rules can be built
in the EC, the rules are generally organised into _Packets_ there.
The processing takes place packet after packet, und from top to bottom within a packet.
For this reason the sequence of the packets is important.

=== Creating a simple rule

Not surprisingly, the EC's configuration is found in the
icon:icon_mkeventd[] [.guihint]#Event Console# WATO module. This is delivered empty
 – i.e., it contains no rules. As previously mentioned,
incoming messages will simply be discarded and not logged. The module looks like this:

image::ec_wato_module.jpg[]

To start, first create a new rule packet with icon:button_new_rule_pack[]:

image::ec_new_rule_pack.png[]

As always, the ID serves as an internal reference and cannot be changed later.
Once saved the first entry will be found in the list of your rule packets:

image::ec_rule_pack_list.png[]

Here, using icon:button_mkeventd_rules[] you can select this so far empty packet
and create a new rule with icon:button_new_rule[].
Simply fill out the first submenu [.guihint]#Rule Properties#:

image::ec_first_rule.jpg[]

The only essentials here are a unique [.guihint]#Rule-ID# and a description. This ID will
later be found in the log files and it will be saved with the generated events.
It is also very useful to assign the IDs systematically. All other fields are optional.
This apples particularly for the conditions.

Important: The new rule is initially only for testing and for now is applied to
_every_ event. Therefore it is also important that it be later
deleted or deactivated! Otherwise the Event Console will be flooded with every
imaginable message of no earthly use and thus be fairly useless.

==== Activating the changes

As always in {CMK} the changes must first be activated before they can take
effect. This is not a disadvantage, since in this way you can decide precisely
when changes affecting multiple interrelated rules should actually go ‘live’.
You can also use the Rule Simulator in advance to test if everything works.

However, since the events are not processed by the monitoring core,
but rather by their own (`mkeventd`) process, the EC has its own
‘Activate Changes’ which is found directly in the WATO-Modul:

image::ec_activate_changes.jpg[]

Click on the icon:button_reload_config[] button to activate the changes.
The Event Console is so constructed that this action proceeds absolutely
_uninterruptedly_. The reception of incoming messages is at all times
assured – thus no messages can be lost.

Only administrators are permitted to activate changes in the EC.
This is controlled using the [.guihint]#Activate changes for event console# link:wato_user.html#roles[Permission].

From Version VERSION[1.4.0] the activation of changes for the Event Console
is bundled with other changes in WATO and is no longer processed separately.

==== Testing the new rule

To test, you can of course send messages through Syslog or SNMP.
You should also do this later. For a first test the EC's built-in [.guihint]#Event Simulator#
is however more practical:

image::ec_simulator.png[]

Here you have two possibilities: [.guihint]#Try out# evaluates, based on the simulated
message, which rules would match. If you find yourself on the highest level of
the EC's WATO module, the rules Packets will be so marked. Should be you be
within a rule packet the individual rules will be marked. Every packet,
or respectively rule, will be flagged with one of the following three symbols:

[cols=2]
|===

|icon:icon_rulematch[] |This rule is the first to assess the message, and consequently decides its fate.
|icon:icon_rulepmatch[] |This rule would apply, but the message has already been processed by a preceeding rule.
|icon:icon_rulenmatch[] |This rule does not apply. Very practical: When you hover the mouse cursor over the grey ball icon, a pop-up will explain why the rule does not apply.
|===


Clicking on [.guihint]#Generate event# works in almost the same way as [.guihint]#Try out#,
except that with this the message will *really be generated*.
Possible defined link:ec.html#actions[Actions] will actually be executed.
The event will in fact appear in the monitoring's list of open events.
The generated message's source text will be visible in the verification:

image::ec_event_generated.png[]

An event generated in this way appears in the Status-GUI in the [.guihint]#Event Console => Events#
view:

image::ec_one_open_event.png[]

==== Creating test messages manually

For a first real test over the network you can simply send a Syslog message from
another Linux computer. Since the protocol is so simple, a special program is not even
required, just use `netcat` or `nc` to simply send the data via UDP.
The UDP-Packet's content consists of a single line of text. When this conforms to
a particular structure the components will be cleanly dissected by the Event Console:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} echo '<78>Dec 18 10:40:00 myserver123 MyApplication: It happened again.' | nc -w 0 -u 10.1.1.94 514
----

You can just send _anything_. The EC will nevertheless accept it and
simply evaluate it as a message text. Additional information, such as e.g.,
the application, the priority, etc., is of course absent.
To be on the safe side, the status {CRIT} will be assumed:

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} echo 'This is no syslog message' | nc -w 0 -u 10.1.1.94 514
----

Within the {CMK}-Instance on which the EC is running, there is a _named Pipe_
in which you can write the text messages locally using `echo`.
This is a very simple method for tethering a local application, and likewise a facility
for testing the processing of messages:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} echo 'Local application says hello' > tmp/run/mkeventd/events
----

Incidentally, here it is also possible to send using the Syslog format,
in order that all of the event's fields can be filled-in cleanly.


[#globalsettings]
=== Event Console global settings

The Event Console has its own global settings which are not found in those of other
modules, rather they are accessed via the icon:context_button_settings[]
button found in the EC-Module's main menu:

image::ec_settings.png[align=center, width=500]

The functions of the individual settings can be learned as usual in the online help
icon:icon_help[], and in the respective section of this article.

Access to these settings is protected by the [.guihint]#Configuration of Event Console#
permission which by default is held by the `admin` role.


[#permissions]
=== Permissions

The Event Console also has its own link:wato_user.html#roles[Roles and Permissions] section.
We will take a closer look at some of the permissions in the relevant parts
of this article.

image::ec_permissions.png[align=center, width=500]


[#operating]
== The Event Console in the operations


=== Event views

Events generated by the Event Console are displayed similarly to hosts and services in
the Status Overview. This display is accessed via the [.guihint]#Event Console => Events# view.
This view can be customised in exactly the same way as with all of the other views.
Displayed events can be filtered, commands executed, etc. If you create new event
views, events and link:ec.html#archive[event history] are available as data sources. Detailed information
covering this can be found in the link:views.html[Views] article:

image::ec_open_events.jpg[]

Clicking on the Event's ID (here e.g., `27`) will open its details:

image::ec_event_details.jpg[]

As can be seen, an event has many data fields whose functions will be explained
one at a time in this article.
I would like to briefly touch on the most important fields here:

[cols="25,~"]
|===
|Field |Function 

|[.guihint]#State (severity of event)# |As mentioned in the introduction, every event is classified as {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN}. Events with an {OK} status are rather uncommon, since the EC has really been conceived to only filter out _problems_. There are however situations in which an {OK}-Event can make sense.
|[.guihint]#Text/Message of the event# |The event's actual content: A text message.
|[.guihint]#Hostname# |The name of the host that sent the message. It is not essential that the host be one that is actively monitored by {CMK}. If a host with this name really exists in the monitoring, the EC automatically establishes a connection. In such a case the [.guihint]#Host alias#, [.guihint]#Host contacts# and [.guihint]#Host icons# fields are filled out and the host appears in the same style as in the active monitoring.
|[.guihint]#Rule-ID# |The ID of the rule which created this event. Clicking on the ID will directly open the rule's details. Incidentally, the ID will still be retained even if in the meantime the rule itself no longer exists.
|===


As mentioned at the beginning, from Version VERSION[1.4.0i2] of
{CMK} events will be displayed directly in the [.guihint]#Tactical Overview#:

image::tactical_overview_events.png[align=center, width=280]

Here three numbers can be seen:

* [.guihint]#Events# – All open and acknowledged events (corresponds to the [.guihint]#Event Console => Events# view).
* [.guihint]#Problems# – only those of which that have one of the {WARN} / {CRIT} / {UNKNOWN} states.
* [.guihint]#Unhandled# – only those of which that have not yet been acknowledged (more on this shortly).


[#commands]
=== Commands and workflow in events

Events will be displayed by a simple workflow analogue to those for hosts and services.
As usual, this is achieved via link:commands.html[commands] – accessed using the small
hammer icon:commands[] icon. With the icon:checkboxes[] checkboxes you can
also execute a command on multiple events simultaneously. As a special feature,
the often-used _‘Archive a single event’_ function is available directly via the
icon:button_delete[] symbol.

For every command there is a link:wato_user.html#roles[Permission] in the
[.guihint]#Event Console# section, with which you can control the commands permitted for each role.
For members of the `admin` and `user` roles all commands are activated by default.

image::ec_commands.png[]

The following commands are available:

==== Update & Acknowledge

Using the [.guihint]#Update# button, with a single action you can hang a comment on an event,
nominate a contact person and acknowledge the event.
The [.guihint]#Change contact# field is intentionally a free text. Here you can also enter
things such as telephone numbers. In particular, the field has no effect on the event's
visibility in the GUI – it is purely a comment field.

The [.guihint]#‘Set event to acknowledged’# checkbox leads to an event passing from the
[.guihint]#open# phase to [.guihint]#acknowledged#, and from then on it is considered as
[.guihint]#handled#. This is analogue to the link:basics_ackn.html[acknowledgement] of host
and service problems.

A later execution of the command without the checkbox being selected
_removes_ the acknowledgement.

==== Changing a state

The [.guihint]#Change state# button allows an event to be reclassified manually –
from {CRIT} to {WARN} for example.

==== Executing actions

With the [.guihint]#Custom Actions# you can allow the execution of freely-definable
link:ec.html#actions[actions] on events.
Initially only the [.guihint]#Send monitoring notification# action is available.
This sends a {CMK}-notification that will be processed in exactly the same way
as a notification from an actively-monitored service.
This passes through the link:notifications.html[notification rules] and, as appropriate,
generates emails, SMS or whatever has been configured.
More information concerning notifications through the EC will be explained link:ec.html#notifications[below].

==== Archiving is almost like deleting

The [.guihint]#Archive event# button finally deletes the event from the open events list.
Since all actions on events – including this deletion – will also be logged in the
link:ec.html#archive[Archive], all of this information can be accessed later at any time.
For this reason we don't speak of deletion, rather of archiving.

The archiving of individual events is also easily performed from the event list
by using the icon:button_delete[] symbol.


[#visibility]
=== Visibility of Events

==== The problem of visibility

{CMK} uses the link:wato_user.html#contact_groups[Contact groups] for the visibility of
hosts and services in the Status-GUI for normal users.
These are assigned to the hosts and services by WATO by rule or folder configuration.

In the Event Console the situation is so that an assignment of events to
contact groups does not exist at first – since in advance it is not actually known
which messages can even be received at all.
Not even the list of hosts is known, as the sockets for Syslog and SNMP are
accessible from everywhere. For this reason there are a couple of specifics
connected with the visibility in the Event Console:

==== All are permitted to see everything initially

When configuring the link:wato_user.html#roles[user roles] the
[.guihint]#Event Console => See all events# permission is given at first.
This is active by default, so that <b>normal users are also permitted to see all
events!</b> This is conciously set like this so that if the configuration is faulty
important error messages don't inadvertently fall by the wayside.
The first step to a more precise control of the visibility is therefore the removal
of this permission from the `user` role.

[#hostmatching]
==== Assigning to hosts

So that the visibility of events is as consistent as possible with the rest
of the monitoring, the event console attempts as best it can to assign the
hosts from which it receives events to the hosts configured using WATO.
This sounds simple but the details are tricky, as sometimes the host name
information is absent in an event and only the IP-address is known.
In other cases the host name is coded differently to the version in WATO.

In practice, an assignment is processed as follows:

* If no host name has been identified in an event, its IP-Address will be used as the host name.
* The event's host name will then – _without case sensitivity_ – be compared with all host names, host aliases and IP-adresses of hosts in the monitoring.
* If such a host is found its contact contact groups will be adopted for the event and used for controlling the visibility.
* If the host is not *not* found, the contact groups – link:ec.html#contactgroups[if configured there] – will be adopted from the rule that generated the event.
* If groups have also not been assigned, the user will only be permitted to see the event if they have the [.guihint]#Event Console => See events not related to a known host# permission.

You can influence the assignment at one position:
If contact groups have been defined in the rule set *and* the host
could be assigned, the assignment normally has priority.

In Version VERSION[1.2.8] you can change this with the
[.guihint]#Global settings => User interface => Precedence of contact groups of events#
setting:

image::ec_contact_group_precedence.png[align=center, width=500]

From Version VERSION[1.4.0i2], instead of the value in the global option
a setting can be made directly in the rule.
This enables a configuration that varies from case to case:

image::ec_outcome_contact_groups.jpg[]


=== Troubleshooting

==== Which rule takes effect, and how often?

With the rule packets...

image::ec_pack_hits.png[]

... as well as with the individual rules...

image::ec_rule_hits.png[]

... in the [.guihint]#Hits# column you will find the counter for how many times the packet,
or respectively, the rule has been matched to a message.
On the one hand this can aid you in the elimination or repair of ineffective rules,
and on the other hand this count can also be interesting for rules that very often match.
For optimum EC performance these rules should be located at the beginning of
the rule chain if possible. In this way the number of rules that the EC must test
against every single message can be reduced.

The counter can be reset at any time with the icon:context_button_reset_counters[]
button.

==== Debugging rule evaluation

In the preceeding chapter we saw how to test the evaluation of your rules using the simulator.
Similar information can be received for the runtimes for _all_
messages, if in the link:ec.html#globalsettings[Settings for the EC] you switch
the [.guihint]#Debug rule execution# to [.guihint]#on#.

The log file from the Event Console is found under `var/log/mkeventd.log`.
For every rule that is tested but does not take effect, here the reason can be found:

.var/log/mkeventd.log
[{file}]
----
[1481020022.001612] Processing message from ('10.40.21.11', 57123): '<22>Dec  6 11:27:02 myserver123 exim[1468]: Delivery complete, 4 message(s) remain.'
[1481020022.001664] Parsed message:

[1481020022.001764]   [hilite]#did not match because of wrong text#
----

It goes without saying that such intensive logging should be used with care
and only if necessary – in a more complex environment _a huge volume_ of data can
be generated!


[#rules]
== The whole power of the rules


=== The criteria

The most important part of an EC-rule is of course the _criteria_
[.guihint]#(Matching criteria)#. Only if a message satisfies all of the criteria
in the rule can the actions defined by the rule be executed and the
evaluation of the message completed.

image::ec_matching_criteria.png[]

==== General information on text comparison

For all criteria associated with text fields, the comparison text is
fundamentally treated as a link:regexes.html[regular expression].
The comparison here is always without _without case sensitivity_.
This latter is in fact an exception to what is usual in {CMK}.
This does make the rule's formulation more robust. Even host names in events
are not necessarily consistent in their format if these have not been centrally
configured, but rather configured on each host itself.
This exception therefore makes good sense.

Furthermore, an _Infix match_ can always be used – a verification of the
_containment_ of a search text.
A `.*` at the beginning or end of the search text is thus not necessary.

There is however an *exception*:
If *no regular expression* is used to match with the host name, but instead a
*fixed host name*, this will be checked for an *exact* agreement and
*not* for containment. Attention: If the text includes a point '.' it will be
treated as a regular expression and an infix search is enacted. `myhost.de`
will then also match `notmyhostide` for example!

[#matchgroups]
==== Match groups

The concept of link:regexes.html#matchgroups[Match groups] in the [.guihint]#Text to match#
field is very important and useful here. This refers to sections of text
that agree when matched with bracketed expressions in regular expressions.

Assume that you wish to monitor the following type of message in a database's log file:

.
[{file}]
----
Database instance WP41 has failed
----

`WP41` is of course variable and you certainly won't want to have to formulate
a separate rule for every possible instance. Thus in the regular expression you can
use `.*` – which represents any character string:

`Database instance .* has failed`

If you now enclose the variable part in parentheses the Event
Console will *note* this exact value when matching for subsequent actions:

`Database instance *(.*)* has failed`

Following a successful match the first match group will now be set to the
`WP41` value (or whichever instance produced the error).

These match groups can be seen in the rule simulator when you hover the
mouse cursor over the green icons:

image::ec_match_groups_1.png[]

The groups can also be seen in the details for the generated event:

image::ec_match_groups_2.png[]

The match groups can also be used in, among others:

* The rewriting of events (link:ec.html#rewriting[Rewriting])
* The automatic cancelling of events (link:ec.html#cancelling[Cancelling])
* The counting of messages (link:ec.html#counting[Counting])

Here is another tip: There are situations in which a string needs to be grouped
within a regular expression, but through which *no* match group should be created.
This can be achieved by using a `?:` directly following the opening parenthesis.
Example: The `one (.*) two (?:.*) three` expression creates only the
`123` match group when matching against `one 123 two 456 three`.

==== IP-Addresses

Here you can match a message to the sender's IPv4-Address.
Enter either an exact address or a network in the
X.X.X.X/Y format – thus, for example, `192.168.8.0/24`, in order to
match all of the addresses in the `192.168.8.`X network.

Please note that the match to the IP-Address only works if the systems being
monitored send directly to the event console. If the message is forwarded
by another intermediate syslog server, this intermediate's address will appear
as the sender's address in the message.


[#syslogfacility]
==== Syslog priority and facility

These two fields were originally defined by syslog as standardised information.
Internally, the 8-bit-field is composed of 5 bits for the Facility
(allowing 32 possibilities) and 3 bits for the Priority (8 possibilities).

The 32 predefined Facilities were conceived for something such as an application.
At the time the selection was not made very forward-looking. One of the Facilities,
for example, is `uucp` - a protocol that was rarely used even in
the '90s of the last milleneum.

The fact is however, that every message received via syslog carries one of
the Facilities. These can to some extent be freely assigned, in order to be
able to filter them in a targeted way later. This is quite useful.

The use of facility and priority also has a performance aspect.
When defining a rule that in any event only applies to messages that all have
the same facility or priority, these should be added to the rules as well.
The event console can then go around these rules very efficiently when a
message with divergent values is received. The more these filters are used
in rules, fewer rule comparisons will then be required.


==== Inverting matches

The [.guihint]#Negate match: Execute this rule if the upper conditions are not fulfilled# checkbox
causes the rule to take effect precisely when all of the conditions have _not _ been met.
This is actually only useful in conjunction with these two types of rule:

* [.guihint]#Do not peform any action, drop this message, stop processing#
* [.guihint]#Skip this rule pack, continue rule execution with next pack#

For more on the rule packs, see link:ec.html#rulepacks[later below].


[#outcome]
=== Outcomes of the rules

==== Rule type: interrupt or generate event

When a rule finds a match it determines what should be done with the message.
This is specified in the [.guihint]#Outcome & Action# menu:

image::ec_outcome.png[]

With [.guihint]#Rule type# the evaluation can be interrupted at this point – completely,
or only the current rule packet.
The first option should be used with a few targeted rules right at the
beginning in order to eliminate a great deal of useless “noise”. The other
options in this menu will then really only be needed to evaluate “normal” rules.


==== Defining the status

The rule decides the event's monitoring status with [.guihint]#State#.
This will generally be {WARN} or {CRIT}. Rules that generate {OK}-Events can be
interesting in exceptional cases in order to show certain events for
purely informational purposes. This can be interesting when used in combination
with an automatic link:ec.html#expire[Expiration] of the event.

Alongside the deciding of an explicit state there are two further more dynamic options.
The [.guihint]#(set by syslog)# setting adopts the classification from the syslog-priority.
This however only functions if the message has already been usably classified by the sender.
Messages that are received directly via syslog have one of eight priorities
predefined by RFC – these are indicated as follows:

[cols=4]
|===
|Priority |ID |State |Definition according to Syslog 

|emerg |0 |{CRIT} |The system is unusable
|alert |1 |{CRIT} |Immediate action is required
|crit |2 |{CRIT} |Critical state
|err |3 |{CRIT} |Error
|warning |4 |{WARN} |Warning
|notice |5 |{OK} |Normal, but important information
|info |6 |{OK} |Purely informational
|debug |7 |{OK} |Debugging message
|===


As well as syslog-messages, messages from the Windows eventlog, and messages from
text files that will have already been classified by the {CMK}-Logwatch plug-in on
the target system produce prepared states. SNMP-traps unfortunately don't produce these.

A completely different method is to classify the message yourself according to the
text. This is achieved using the [.guihint]#(set by message text)# setting:

image::ec_state_by_text.png[]

The match with the text configured at this point will be performed only
after [.guihint]#Text to match# and the other rules have been evaluated.
This must therefore not be repeated here.

If none of the configured patterns is found the event takes the {UNKNOWN} state.


==== Service level

The idea behind the Service Level is that within an operation,
every host and service has a specific importance.
With this a concrete service level agreement can then be formulated.
In {CMK} using link:wato_rules.html[Rules] you can assign such levels to your hosts
and services and then, for example, make the notifications or self-defined dashboards
dependent on these.

Since events are at first not necessarily correlated with hosts or Services,
the Event Console likewise allows you to assign a service level to an event
using rules. You can then later filter the event view according to this level.

As standard {CMK} has four predefined levels – 0 (None), 10 (Silver), 20 (Gold)
and 30 (Platinum). This selection can be altered as desired in the
[.guihint]#Global settings => Notifcations => Service levels#. Decisive here is the level's number,
since the levels will be sorted according to these numbers and checked against
the importance as well.

[#contactgroups]
==== Contact groups

The contact groups are also used for the link:ec.html#visibility[visibility], and from Version
VERSION[1.4.0] also used for event
link:ec.html#notifications[Notification]. Here you can assign contact groups explicitly
by using Rule Events. Details for this can be found in the link:ec.html#visibility[section on operation].


==== Actions

Actions are very similar to the link:alert_handlers.html[alert handlers] for hosts and services.
Here when opening an event you can allow your own defined script to be executed.
All of the detailed information concerning actions can be found further below in its own
link:ec.html#actions[section].


==== Automatic deletion

The automatic deletion (= Archive), which you can specify with
[.guihint]#Delete event immediately after the actions#, ultimately makes an event no
longer visible in the operation. This is then useful if you simply want to
trigger automatic actions or when you wish to only archive particular events for
later research.


[#rewriting]
=== Automatic text rewriting

With [.guihint]#Rewriting#, an EC-rule can automatically rewrite text fields
in a message and add also comments to them. This is configured in its own menu:

image::ec_rewriting.png[]

With the rewriting, the link:ec.html#matchgroups[Matchgroups] described above are
particularly important. These allow you to insert elements of the original
message into the new text.
When making the substitutions you can access the groups as follows:

[cols="10,10"]
|===

|\1 |Will be replaced by the original message's _first_ matchgroup.
|\2 |Will be replaced by the original message's _second_ matchgroup (etc.).
|\0 |Will be replaced by the _complete_ original message
|===


In the above screenshot the new message text will be replaced by `Instance \1 has been shut down.`
This will of course only work if the [.guihint]#Text to match# in the *same* rule as the regular search expressions also contains at least one bracket term. An example of such a case would be:

image::ec_rewrite_match.png[]


A few more tips on rewriting:

* The rewriting is done _after_ the matching and _before_ actions are executed.
* Match, rewrite and actions always occur in the same rule. It is not possible to rewrite a message in order to then process it with a later rule.
* The `\1`, `\2`, etc., expressions can be used in all text fields, not just in [.guihint]#Message text#.


[#cancelling]
=== Automatic event cancelling

Some applications or devices are nice enough to send an appropriate OK-message
once they have recovered from a problem.
The EC can be configured so that in such a case the event generated by
the problem can be automatically closed. This is referred to as [.guihint]#Cancelling#.

The following image shows a rule in which messages with the
text `ABC Instance (.*) failed` will be searched for.
The expression `(.*)` allows for any character string that
is captured by one member of a link:ec.html#matchgroups[matchgroup].
The expression `ABC Instance (.*) recovered` which is configured in
the [.guihint]#Text to cancel event(s)# field in the same rule ensures an automatic
closure of events generated by this rule when an appropriate message is received:

image::ec_cancelling.png[]

The automatic cancellation then functions precisely when:

* a message is received that matches with the text [.guihint]#Text to cancel event(s)#
* The value captured in the `(.*)` group is _identical_ to the matchgroup that generated the original message
* both messages came from the same host
* it deals with the same application (Field [.guihint]#Application#)

The principle of the matchgroups is very important here. It would not really make
very much sense if the message `ABC Instance TEST recovered` cancelled an
event that was started by the message `ABC Instance PROD failed` would it?

Please don't make the mistake of using the placeholder `\1` in [.guihint]#Text to cancel events(s)#.
This does _not_ work! This placeholder only functions with link:ec.html#rewriting[rewriting].


==== Executing actions when cancelling

When cancelling an event you can also allow link:ec.html#automatic_actions[actions]
to execute automatically. For this reason it is important to know that when
cancelling an event a number of the event's data fields will be overwritten by values
from the OK-message before the actions are executed!
In these way the OK-message's data is fully available in the action script.
The event's state is also flagged as {OK} during this phase.
In this manner an action script can recognise a cancellation, and you can use the
same script for errors and OK-messages (e.g., when linking to a ticket system).

The following fields will be overwritten with data from an OK-message:

* The message text
* The timestamp
* The time of the last occurrence
* The Syslog-priority

All other fields remain unchanged – including the Event-ID.


==== Cancellation in combination with rewriting

If you work with rewriting and link:ec.html#cancelling[cancelling] in the same rule,
you should be cautious when rewriting the host name or the application.
When cancelling, the EC always checks whether the cancellation message corresponds
to the open event's host name and application. If these were to be overwritten however,
the cancellation would never work.

Before a cancellation the Event Console therefore simulates a rewriting of the
host name and application in order to compare the relevant texts.
This is probably also what you would expect.

This behaviour can be made use of if the [.guihint]#Application#-field in the error
message and the subsequent OK-message are not the same!
In such a case simply change the application field to a known fixed value,
which will result in the field being ignored during a cancellation.


==== Cancellation on the basis of the Syslog-priority

There are (unfortunately) situations in which the error's text and OK-message
are absolutely identical. In most such cases the real state is not coded in the text,
rather it is found in the Syslog-priority.

Additionally there is the [.guihint]#Syslog priority to cancel event# option.
Here, for example, enter the range `debug` ... `notice`.
All priorities within this range will normally be evaluated as an OK-state.
When using this option you should _nevertheless_ enter an appropriate text
in the [.guihint]#Text to cancel event(s)# field – otherwise the rule will match to all
OK-messages that apply to the same applications.


[#counting]
=== Counting messages

The ‘Counting of similar messages’ option can be found in the [.guihint]#Counting & Timing# submenu.
The idea is that some messages first become relevant when they
occur _too often_ or _too rarely_.


==== Too frequent messages

Checking for messages that occur too frequently is activated with the
[.guihint]#Count messages in defined interval# option:

image::ec_counting.png[]

In this menu you first enter a time span in “[.guihint]#Time period for counting#” and,
in “[.guihint]#Count until triggered#”, the number of messages to be reached in order
to trigger the opening of an event. As an example, in the above illustration it
can be seen that these values have been set to ten messages per hour.
Of course not just any message will be counted – only those specified for matching
in the rule.

It is also normally not useful to simply count all matching messages,
rather only those triggered by the same ‘cause‘.
In order to be able to control this, there are three check boxes with the title
“[.guihint]#Force separate events for different ...#”. These are predefined to count only
messages that match:

* Host
* Application
* link:ec.html#matchgroups[Match groups]

With these you can formulate rules like _“If from the same host,
the same application, and there the same instance more than 10 messages
per hour are received, then...”_. It is thereby also possible that multiple
events can be generated on the basis of the single rule.

If you select, for example, all three check boxes, the counting will be
conducted globally and altogether the rule can open only a single event!

Incidentally, it can actually be sensible to enter a message-count of ‘1’!
With this value you can effectively keep a grip on an ‘event storm’.
If for example, 100 messages of the same type arise within a short time,
by using this value only a single event will however be generated.
In the event's details you will then see:

* The time at which the first message appeared
* The time of the latest message
* The total count of messages accumulated to generate the event

Once the case has been ‘closed’, to specify when subsequent new messages
should open a new event can be decided via two check boxes.
Normally an acknowledgement of an event resets the counter so that subsequent
messages begin a new count. This can be deactivated in the
[.guihint]#‘Continue counting when event is acknowledged’# option.

The [.guihint]#Discontinue counting after time has elapsed# option
(From Version VERSION[1.4.0]) ensures that for every comparison
period a separate event will always be opened. In the above example we
have defined a threshold of ten messages per hour. If this option has been
activated, for an already opened event a maximum of one hour's messages
can be accumulated in total. As soon as this time period has expired
(if a sufficient number of messages have been received) a new event will be opened.

If the count is set to ‘1’, for example, and the time interval to one day,
then this message type will open a maximum of one event per day.

The [.guihint]#Algorithm# setting is possibly surprising at first sight.
But seriously, what is actually meant by “ten messages per hour”?
WHICH hour is meant by this? Always full hours during the day?
It can happen that nine messages are received in the last minute of an hour,
and a further nine messages are received in the first minute of the following hour.
This means that eighteen messages will have been received in two minutes,
which is nonetheless fewer than ten per hour, so that the rule will not trigger an event.
That doesn't sound very useful...

Since there is no single solution for this {CMK} provides three different
definitions of what “ten messages per hour” should actually mean:

[cols="20,~"]
|===
|Algorithm |Function 

|[.guihint]#Interval# |The timing interval begins when the first applicable message is received. An event in the [.guihint]#counting# phase will be generated. Should the defined time period expire before the defined count limit is reached the event will be silently deleted. If however the count limit is reached before the time period has expired, then the event will be opened _immediately_ (triggering any possibly configured action).
|[.guihint]#Token Bucket# |This algorithm does not work with fixed time periods, rather it implements a procedure that is often used for Trafficshaping in networks.  Let us assume that ten messages per hour have been configured. That is an average of six per minute. If an applicable message is received, an event in the [.guihint]#counting# phase will be generated and its count set to ‘1’. Every subsequent message will increment this count by one. And every six minutes the counter will be _reduced_ by one – regardless of whether a message has been received or not. If with this procedure the counter returns to zero the event will be deleted.  The trigger will thus be pulled when the _average_ rate that messages are received persistently remains at over ten per hour.
|[.guihint]#Dynamic Token Bucket# |This is a variant of the [.guihint]#Token Bucket# algorithm in which the counter is reduced more slowly as it becomes lower. In the above example the counter with a count of 5 will be reduced every _twelve_ minutes rather than every six.  The result is that message rates that are only just above the permitted rate open an event (and thus create a notification) noticibly quicker.
|===


Which algorithm should you choose then?

* [.guihint]#Interval# is the easiest to understand and is simpler to replicate if you later want to precisely check statistics in the Syslog archive.
* [.guihint]#Token Bucket# is in comparison more intelligent and ‘softer’. It creates fewer anomalies on the margins of intervals.
* [.guihint]#Dynamic Token Bucket# makes a system more reactive and generates alarms more quickly.

Events that have not yet reached the defined count are latently present,
but not automatically visible to the operator.
They are in the [.guihint]#counting# phase. Such events can be made visible in
the Events View with the [.guihint]#Phase# filter:

image::ec_phase_filter_counting.png[align=center, width=320]

[#expect]
==== Too rare or absent messages

Just as with the receipt of a particular message, an *absence* can also
indicate a problem. It is possible that a particular job should issue at
least one message per day. Should this message not have been received however,
the job has probably not been run and thus an investigation is urgently needed.

You can configure something like this under
[.guihint]#Counting & Timing => Expect regular messages#:

image::ec_expect_messages.png[]

The same as for the counting submenu – in this case enter a time period within
which the message(s) are expected. Here however, a quite different,
much more suitable algorithm is used. Namely, the time period is always
targeted exactly at defined locations.
So, for example, the [.guihint]#Hour# interval always begins with zero minutes and seconds.
The following options are available:

[cols="25,~"]
|===
|Interval |Orientation 

|[.guihint]#10 seconds# |With a second count divisible by 10
|[.guihint]#minute# |To the full minute
|[.guihint]#5 minutes# |At 0:00, 0:05, 0:10, etc.
|[.guihint]#15 minutes# |At 0:00, 0:15, 0:30, 0:45, etc.
|[.guihint]#hour# |At the start of every full hour
|[.guihint]#day# |Exactly at 00:00, but only in a configurable time zone. With this you can also specify that a message is expected between 12:00 on one day and 12:00 on the following day. If, for example you yourself are located in the [.guihint]#UTC+1# time zone, enter [.guihint]#UTC-11# here.
|[.guihint]#two days# |To begin a full hour. Here you can enter a time zone offset from 0 to 47, which is referenced to 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
|[.guihint]#week# |At 00:00 on Thursday morning in the time zone UTC, plus the offset in hours. Thursday because the 1.1.1970 – the start of the ‘Epoch’ – was a Thursday.
|===


Why is this all so complicated? The intention is to minimise false alarms.
Is, for example one message per day expected from a backup? There are probably
slight variations in the backup's duration, so that the messages will not be
issued exactly twenty-four hours apart. If a message is expected, for example,
at around midnight plus/minus one or two hours, an interval of from 12:00 to 12:00
is much more robust than from 00:00 to 00:00. This will mean however that a
notification event will be not be generated until 12:00 if the message is absent.


==== Multiple occurrences of the same problem

The [.guihint]#Merge with open event# option is predefined so that if an expected message
repeatedly fails to appear the existing open event will be updated.
As an alternative this can be switched so that multiple new events will be opened.


[#timing]
=== Timing

Under [.guihint]#Counting & Timing# there are two options which can influence the
opening, or respectively the automatic closing of events.

The [.guihint]#Delay event creation# option is useful if you work with
automatic link:ec.html#cancelling[cancelling] of events. Set a delay of
5 minutes for example, so that an event generated by an error message
pauses for five minutes in the [.guihint]#delayed# status in the hope that
within this time an OK-message will be received which will automatically
close the event without a cancellation being needed, and thus the event
doesn't impinge on the operation. If this time limit expires the event
will be opened and a possible defined action will be executed:

image::ec_delay.png[align=center, width=530]

The [.guihint]#Limit event lifetime# option performs more or less an opposite function.
With this events can be be permitted to close automatically at the end of
a specified time. This is useful, for example, for informative events with
an {OK}-status which should be displayed, but which should not generate
activities in the operation. With the automatic ‘aging’ function you can
be spared the manual deletion of such messages:

image::ec_limit_livetime.png[align=center, width=530]

With an acknowledgement the aging will initially be stopped. This behaviour
can however be adjusted using the two check boxes.

[#rulepacks]
=== Rule packs

Rule packs are not just intended to lay things out more clearly, but rather to
considerably simplify the configuration of multiple similar rules and
simultaneously to accelerate evaluations.

Let us assume that you have a set of twenty rules, all of which revolve around
the Windows Event Log [.guihint]#Security#. All of these rules share the condition of
checking for a specific text in the application field (this logfile's name
will be coded as an [.guihint]#Application# in the messages by the EC).
In such a situation, proceed as follows:

. Create a rulepack for these rules.
. Create the 20 rules for [.guihint]#Security# in this pack, or move them here (the selection list [.guihint]#Move to pack...# on the right in the rule table).
. Remove the condition for the application from all of these rules.
. *As the first rule* in the pack, create a rule that allows the event to simply bypass the pack if the application is _not_ [.guihint]#Security#.

This exclusion rule is coded as follows:

* [.guihint]#Matching criteria => Match syslog application (tag)# to `Security`
* [.guihint]#Matching criteria => Invert matching# to [.guihint]#Negate match: Execute this rule if the upper conditions are not fulfilled.#
* [.guihint]#Outcome & action => Rule type# to [.guihint]#Skip this rulepack, continue rule execution with next rulepack#

Every message that does not come from the Security-Log will thus be ‘rejected’
by the first rule in this pack. This not only simplifies the subsequent rules
in this pack, it also accelerates the processing since in most cases checking
will no longer be necessary.


[#actions]
== Executing actions

=== Types of action

The Event Console provides three types of action – which can be executed either
manually, or when opening or link:ec.html#cancel[cancelling] events:

* Executing your own self-coded shell scripts
* Sending your own self-defined emails
* Creation of {CMK}-link:ec.html#notifications[notifications]


=== Shell scripts and emails

Emails and scripts must first be defined in the Event
Console's settings. These can be found under [.guihint]#Actions (Emails & Scripts)#:

image::ec_add_action.png[]

==== Executing shell scripts

Create a new action with the [.guihint]#Add new action# button. The following example
shows how to create a simple shell script as an [.guihint]#Execute shell script# type
of action. In the script you can include placeholders such as
`$ID$` or `$HOST$` that will be replaced by real values from
the event before the script is executed. A complete list of the available
placeholders can be found in the icon:icon_help[] online help.

image::ec_define_action.png[]

Please be aware: under some circumstances it is possible that an attacker
could infiltrate commands into scripts using their own content in event texts.
This is particularly so for the `$TEXT$` field.
This is due to the placeholder being substituted *before* the
script is executed.

In future there will be an extension in {CMK} that as an alternative
will enable the values to be delivered via environment variables
(similarly to the scripts in the link:notifications.html#methods[notification methods]).
Since these are then evaluated by the shell itself, this risk can be avoided
with correct use. Thus, only utilise the existing variants with placeholders
if you can prevent attackers from infiltrating events.

The example script seen in the screenshot creates the `tmp/test.out` file
in the instance folder, and there writes a text with the concrete values for
the variables from each latest event:

.
[{file}]
----
cat << EOF > $OMD_ROOT/tmp/test.out
Something happened:

Event-ID: $ID$
Host: $HOST$
Application: $APPLICATION$
Message: $TEXT$
EOF
----

The scripts will be executed in the following environment:

* `/bin/bash` will be used as the interpreter
* The script runs as an instance user with the instance's home folder (e.g. `/omd/sites/mysite`)
* When the script is running processing of further events is paused!

Should your script include waiting times, with the help of
the Linux `at`-spooler you can allow it to run asynchronously.
For this, create the script in its own file `local/bin/myaction`,
and start it with the `at`-command – e.g.:

.
[{file}]
----
echo "$OMD_ROOT/local/bin/myaction '$HOST$' '$TEXT$' | at now
----


==== Sending emails

The action type [.guihint]#Send email# sends a simple text mail.
This can in fact be indirectly achieved via a script,
for example, by working with the `mail` command
in the command line. The first-mentioned option is however easier.
Please note that placeholders are also allowed in the [.guihint]#Recipient email address#
and [.guihint]#Subject# fields.

image::ec_define_action_email.png[]


[#notifications]
=== Notifications via {CMK}

Alongside the execution of scripts and the sending of (simple) emails,
the EC can perform a third type of action – the sending of notifications
over the {CMK}-link:notifications.html[notifications system].
EC-generated notifications are processed in the same way as the
host and service alarms from the active monitoring.
The advantages over the simple emails as described above are obvious:

* The notifications for active and event-based monitoring are configured together in a central location.
* Functions like link:notifications.html#bulk[bulk notifications], HTML-emails and other useful things are available for use.
* User-defined notification rules, cancelling of notifications, and so on, function in the usual way.

The action type [.guihint]#Send monitoring notification# that performs this is
as standard always available for use, and needs no special configuration.

Since events by their very nature are somewhat differerent to ‘normal’
hosts or services, there are a few special characteristics with their
notifications which we will now take a closer look at:

==== Assigning to existing hosts

Events can originate from any host – regardless of whether they are
configured in an active monitoring or not.
The Syslog and SNMP-Port are, after all, open to all hosts in the network.
If a host sends information without having been asked,
the sender address reveals little about the sender itself,
and at first we don't know if we have a file of further information
concerning the host, thus any extended host attributes such as alias,
host attributes, contacts, etc. are at first 'unknown'.
In particular this means that _conditions_ in notification rules
do not not necessarily function as expected.

From Version VERSION[1.4.0], when handling notifications the EC
attempts to find a host in the active monitoring that matches the event.
For this it makes use of the same procedure as with the
link:ec.html#visibility[visibility of events]. If such a host can be found,
the following data will be extracted from it:

* The correct spelling of the host's name
* The host alias
* The primary IP-address as configured in {CMK}
* The host tags
* The WATO-folder
* The list of contacts and contact groups

It can thereby happen that the host name in the notification is not
identical to the  host name in the original message. The adaption of this to
conform with that of the active monitoring however simplifies the formulation
of standardised notification rules which contain conditions for the host names.

The assignment occurs in realtime with a livestatus query to the monitoring core
running in the same instance as the EC which received the message.
This can of course only function if the syslog messages, SNMP-Traps, etc.,
are only sent to the {CMK}-instance on which the host is actively monitored!

If the query fails, the host cannot be found, or you are using
{CMK} Version VERSION[1.2.8], substitute data will be assumed:

[cols="25,~"]
|===

|[.guihint]#Hostname# |The host name from the event
|[.guihint]#Hostalias# |The host name will be used as an alias
|[.guihint]#IP-Address# |The IP-Address field contains the host name – if this has the format of an IP-Address, and is otherwise empty. But Version VERSION[1.4.0] will insert the message's original sender-address here.
|[.guihint]#Host attributes# |The host receives no tag. If you have tag groups with blank tags, the host there takes these attributes, otherwise it has no tag from the group. Please be aware of this if in notification rules you define conditions via tags.
|[.guihint]#WATO-Folder# |No folder. All conditions going to a specific folder are thus unrealisable – even if it concerns the main folder.
|[.guihint]#Contacts# |The list of the contacts is empty. From Version VERSION[1.4.0] the fallback-contacts will be inserted here.
|===


If the host cannot be assigned in active monitoring,
this can of course lead to problems with notifications.
On the one hand it is possible that the conditions can no longer be applied,
on the other hand the contact selection will be affected.
In such cases you can customise the notification rules so that notifications
from the event console can be treated using their own targeted rule.
This has its own condition with which you can either make a positive match only
to EC-notifications, or conversely, exclude them:

image::ec_notification_condition.png[]


==== Remaining notification fields

So that notifications from the EC can be processed by the active monitoring's
notification system, the EC must conform to the system's schema.
In the process the typical data fields in a monitoring notification will be
filled as sensibly as possible. How the host's data is identified has just been
described. Further fields are:

[cols="25,~"]
|===

|[.guihint]#Alarmtyp# |EC-notifications are always treated as a _Service notification_
|[.guihint]#Service description# |Here the [.guihint]#Application# field from the event will be inserted. If this is empty, up to {CMK} Version VERSION[1.2.8] ‘`Unset`’ will be inserted, from {CMK} Version VERSION[1.4.0] ‘`Event Console`’ will be inserted.
|[.guihint]#Notification number# |This has a fixed value of `1`. No escalation is possible from this value. Even multiple sequential events of the same type appear independent from each other. The EC does not currently support recurring notifications in the case of an event not being acknowledged.
|[.guihint]#Date / Time# |With events, the link:ec.html#counting[counting], is the time of the _last_ occurrence of a message associated with an event.
|[.guihint]#Plug-in output# |The text content of an event
|[.guihint]#Service state# |The event's state, i.e., {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN}
|[.guihint]#Previous state# |Since events have no previous states, normal events will always be {OK} here, and cancelled events will always receive a {CRIT} entry. This rule comes the closest to what one needs to have for a notification rule that is conditional on the exact change of state!
|===



==== Configuring contact groups manually

As described above, it may not be possible to determine the applicable
contacts for an event automatically. For such cases, from {CMK}
Version VERSION[1.4.0], you can specify the contact groups to be
used for the notification directly in the EC-rule.
Important – don't forget the [.guihint]#Use in notifications# check box:

image::ec_set_contact_groups.png[]

*Attention*: the similar setting in Version VERSION[1.2.8] applies
exclusively to the visibility, NOT to the notification!


==== Global switch for notifications

In the [.guihint]#Master Control# element there is a central switch for notifications.
From {CMK} Version VERSION[1.4.0] this also affects notifications
that are relayed from the EC:

image::master_control_notifications_off.png[align=center, width=280]

As with the host allocation, an enquiry to the switch from the EC requires a
livestatus access on the local monitoring core.
A successful request can be seen in the Event Console's logfile:

.var/log/mkeventd.log
[{file}]
----
[1482142567.147669] Notifications are currently disabled. Skipped notification for event 44
----


==== Hosts in scheduled downtimes

From Version VERSION[1.4.0] the event console recognises hosts
that are currently in a link:basics_downtimes.html[scheduled downtime] and issues no
notification in such a situation. Its logfile entry will look like this:

.var/log/mkeventd.log
[{file}]
----
[1482144021.310723] Host myserver123 is currently in scheduled downtime. Skipping notification of event 433.
----

The prerequisite of course is successfully finding the host in the active monitoring.
If this is not successful it will be assumed that the host is _not_ in maintenance,
and the notification will definitely be generated.


==== Auxiliary macros

If you code your own link:notifications.html#scripts[notification scripts],
especially with notifications from the event console, you have a number
of additional variables available that describe the original event
(access as usual with the `NOTIFY_` prefix):

[cols=2]
|===

|EC_ID |Event-ID
|EC_RULE_ID |ID of the rule that generated the event
|EC_PRIORITY |Syslog priority as a number from `0` (`emerg`) to `7` (`debug`).
|EC_FACILITY |Syslog facility – likewise a number. The range of values is from `0` (`kern`) to `32` (`snmptrap`).
|EC_PHASE |Phase of the event. Since only open events can trigger actions, `open` should be present here. A manual notification of an already acknowledged event, will `ack` will be seen here
|EC_COMMENT |The event's comment field
|EC_OWNER |The [.guihint]#Owner# field
|EC_CONTACT |The comment field with the contact information
|EC_PID |The process-ID of the process that sent the message (bei Syslog-Events)
|EC_MATCH_GROUPS |The match groups from matches in the rule
|EC_CONTACT_GROUPS |The optional contact groups defined manually in the rule
|===


[#automatic_actions]
=== Executing actions

We have already seen the manual execution of actions by the operator in
link:ec.html#commands[Commands]. More interesting is the automatic execution of
actions, which in EC-rules can be configured in the [.guihint]#Outcome & Action# submenu:

image::ec_rule_actions.png[]

Here you can choose one or more actions that will always be executed when,
according to the rule, an event will be _opened_ or link:ec.html#cancel[cancelled].
With the latter, via the [.guihint]#Do Cancelling-Actions when# check box you can define
whether the action should be executed if the cancelled event is already in the [.guihint]#open# phase.
With the use of link:ec.html#counting[counting] or
link:ec.html#delay[delay] it can occur that events
are cancelled which were in a ‘wait’ status and not yet visible to the user.

The execution of actions will be logged in the `var/log/mkevent.log`
logfile:

.var/log/mkeventd.log
[{file}]
----
[1481120419.712534] Executing command: ACTION;1;omdadmin;test
[1481120419.718173]   Exitcode: 0
----

These will also be noted in the event archive.

[#snmp]
== SNMP-Traps

=== Setting up the reception of SNMP-Traps

Since the Event Console has its own built-in SNMP-Engine, setting up the reception
of SNMP-Traps is very simple. No `snmptrapd` from the operating system is needed!
Should you already have one running, please stop it.

As described in the section on link:ec.html#setup[setting up] the Event Console,
now activate the trap receiver in this instance with `omd config`:

image::ec_config_traps.png[align=center, width=300]

Because the UDP-Port for the traps can only be used by one process on a server,
it may only be setup for a single {CMK}-instance per computer.
When starting the instance you can control whether the trap receiver is active:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd start
Starting mkeventd (builtin: [hilite]#snmptrap#)...OK
Starting Livestatus Proxy-Daemon...OK
Starting mknotifyd...OK
Starting rrdcached...OK
Starting Check_MK Micro Core...OK
Starting dedicated Apache for site mysite...OK
Initializing Crontab...OK
----

For SNMP-Traps to function, the sender and receiver must agree in
specific [.guihint]#Credentials#. In the cases of SNMP Version 1 and 2c it is a
simple password, referred to here as ‘Community’. With Version 3 a few
more details are required. These credentials are configured in the event console's
settings under [.guihint]#Credentials for processing SNMP traps#.
Various different credentials can be set up with the [.guihint]#Add new element# button
which are then available to the devices for alternate uses:

image::ec_trap_credentials.png[]

By far the most time-consuming part is of course the entering of the target
addresses for the traps on all of the target devices to be monitored,
as well as to configure the credentials there.

*Tip*: Up until {CMK} Version VERSION[1.2.8] traps with the
`public` community were always automatically accepted, regardless of any
further configured credentials. From VERSION[1.4.0] this is no longer
the case – here only explicitly-configured credentials are permitted.

=== Testing

Unfortunately, few devices offer effective testing capabilities.
At least you can test the reception of traps by the event console quite simply
by sending a test trap – ideally from another Linux system.
This is done with the `snmptrap` command.
The following example sends a trap to `192.168.178.11`. Your chosen
host name is entered after `.1.3.6.1` and it must be resolvable
or entered as an IP-Address (here `192.168.178.30`):

[{shell}]
----
{c-user} snmptrap -v 1 -c public 192.168.178.11 .1.3.6.1 192.168.178.30 6 17 '' .1.3.6.1 s "Just kidding"
----

If the [.guihint]#Log level# in the settings has been set to [.guihint]#Verbose logging#,
the reception and evaluation of the traps will be visible in the EC's logfile:

.var/log/mkeventd.log
[{file}]
----
[1482387549.481439] Trap received from 192.168.178.30:56772. Checking for acceptance now.
[1482387549.485096] Trap accepted from 192.168.178.30 (ContextEngineId "0x80004fb8054b6c617070666973636816893b00", ContextName "")
[1482387549.485136] 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0                        = 329887
[1482387549.485146] 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0                    = 1.3.6.1.0.17
[1482387549.485186] 1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.3.0                     = 192.168.178.30
[1482387549.485219] 1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.4.0                     =
[1482387549.485238] 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.3.0                    = 1.3.6.1
[1482387549.485258] 1.3.6.1                                  = Just kidding
----

If the credentials are false only a single line will be displayed:

.var/log/mkeventd.log
[{file}]
----
[1482387556.477364] Trap received from 192.168.178.30:56772. Checking for acceptance now.
----

An event generated by such a trap will look like this:

image::ec_trap_event.png[]

=== From numbers come texts, but also: translating traps

SNMP is a binary protocol and it is very economical with its textual descriptions
of messages. Which type of traps are involved is communicated internally by
a sequence of numbers in so-called OIDs. These are shown as strings of numbers
separated by periods (e.g. `1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.3.0`).

With the help of so-called MIB-files (Management Information Base) the
event console can translate these number sequences into texts. So for example,
from `1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.3.0`, the text `SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0`
will be derived.

The translation of the traps is activated in the event console's settings:

image::ec_translate_traps.png[]

The above test trap now generates a somewhat different event:

image::ec_trap_event_translated.png[]

If the [.guihint]#Add OID descriptions# option has been activated, the result will be
significantly more comprehensive – and more complicated.
Is does however help to better understand exactly what a trap means:

image::ec_trap_event_translated2.png[]

=== Uploading your own MIBs

Unfortunately the advantages of Open Source for the authoring of MIB-files haven't
become common knowledge yet, and thus at the {CMK} project we are regrettably
not in the position of being able to provide vendor-specific MIB-files.
Only a small collection of free basic-MIBs is preinstalled to handle,
e.g., a translation of `sysUpTime`.

But, in the event console, with the icon:context_button_snmp_mibs[] button,
you can upload your own MIB-files, as has been done here by the
_Lieber Corporation_ with its own MIBs:

image::ec_mibs_for_translation.jpg[]

Tips for MIBs:

* The uploaded files are stored in `local/share/snmp/mibs`. You can also store them there manually if the method using the GUI is too involved for you.
* Instead of individual files, you can upload ZIP-archives with collected MIBs all in one go.
* MIBs have dependencies among themselves. Missing MIBs will be reported by {CMK}.
* The uploaded MIBs will also be used on the `cmk --snmptranslate` command line.


[#logwatch]
== Monitoring log files

The {CMK}-Agent is able to evaluate log files using the [.guihint]#Logwatch#-plug-in.
First of all, this plug-in provides its own monitoring of log files
(independently from the event console), which includes a small GUI integrated in
{CMK} for viewing and acknowledging of found messages.
There is also the possibility of forwarding messages found by the plug-in
to the event console on a one-to-one basis.

Log file monitoring is fully integrated in the Windows agent –
in the form of a plug-in for evaluating text files, and another for the
Windows-Eventlogs. For Linux and Unix the `mk_logwatch` plug-in written
in Python is available. All three can be installed and/or configured using the
link:wato_monitoringagents.html#bakery[Agent Bakery]. Use the following rule sets for these:

* [.guihint]#Text logfiles (Linux)#
* [.guihint]#Text logfiles (Windows)#
* [.guihint]#Finetune Windows Eventlog monitoring#

The precise configuration of the logwatch plug-in is not the subject of this article.
It is nonetheless still important that in the logwatch plug-in itself you prepare
the best possible prefiltering of the messages, and not simply send the complete
contents of a text file to the event console.

Please don't confuse this with the _subsequent_ reclassification via
the [.guihint]#Logwatch patterns# rule set. This can only change the status of messages
that have already been sent by agents. If you have already set up these patterns
however, and simply wish to switch from logwatch to the event console you can
still retain the patterns. Additionally, included in the forwarding there is the
[.guihint]#Reclassify messages before forwarding them to the EC# option.
In this scenario all messages pass through alltogether *three* rule chains:
on the agents, through the reclassification, and in the Event Console!

Now change the logwatch over so that the messages found by the plug-ins
are no longer monitored by the normal Logwatch-Check, rather they are
forwarded one-to-one to the event console for processing. This forwarding
service is performed by the [.guihint]#Parameters for discovered services => Applications, Services & Processes => Logwatch Event Console Forwarding#
rule set:

image::ec_logwatch_forwarding.png[]

A few helpful tips concerning forwarding:

If you have a distributed environment in which not every instance runs its own
event console (first possible from Version VERSION[1.4.0]),
the remote instances must redirect the messages to the central console via syslog.
UDP is the default for this procedure. This however is not a secure protocol.
It is better to use syslog via TCP, which must of course be activated in the
processing centre (`omd config`).

When forwarding specify any [.guihint]#Syslog facility#. With the help of this you can
easily recognise the forwarded messages in the event console.
`local0` to `local7` are well suited for this.

With [.guihint]#List of expected logfiles# you can monitor the list of found logfiles,
and will be warned when particular expected files cannot be found.

Important: Just saving the rules achieves nothing. This rule only becomes active
through a service dicovery. Not until this has been executed will the existing
logwatch services be removed, and replaced in each host by a newly-created
_single_ new service with the name [.guihint]#Log Forwarding#.

image::ec_log_forwarding_check.png[]

This check will also display possible problems with forwarding to the
event console in the future.

== Conforming host names on receipt

The host names used by your devices in messages are unfortunately not always
consistent. As we have already seen, when sending notifications {CMK} attempts
as far as possible to automatically assign the host names from events in
active monitoring when assigning the event's checks, and when displaying the
events in the operation. At the same time upper and lower case use will be
standardised, and the alias as well as the IP-address will be tested as host names.

If that is not sufficient, you can already rewrite host names directly on receipt
of messages with the [.guihint]#Hostname translation for incoming messages# EC-setting.
There are numerous possibilities for this:

image::ec_hostname_translation.png[]

The most flexible method is to use link:regexes.html[regular expressions], which
allow quasi-intelligent ‘find and replace’ actions in the host names.
In cases where that won't do you can also provide a table of individual names
and their corresponding new versions.

*Important*: The name conversion is performed *before* processing the
rule conditions, and thus long before a possible rewriting of the host names
through a rule action [.guihint]#Rewrite hostname#.


== Viewing event states in active monitoring

When you also wish to see which hosts in the active monitoring currently have
open problem events, in each host you can add an active check which summarises
the current event states.
For a host currently without open events, it will look like this:

image::ec_events_check_none.png[]

If only events with an {OK} state are present, the check will show the
number of events, but remain green:

image::ec_events_check_ok.png[]

Here is a situation with open events in a {CRIT} state:

image::ec_events_check_crit.png[]

This active check is generated using a rule in the
[.guihint]#Host & Service Parameters => Event Console => Check event state in Event Console#
rule set.
When using this rule you can also specify whether already-acknowledged events should,
or should not be added to the state:

image::ec_events_check.png[]

With the [.guihint]#Application (regular expression)# option you can restrict the check
to events that have a specific text in the application field. In this case it can also
make sense to have more than one events check on a host, and to separate the checks
according to application. So that these services are distinguishable by name,
you will additionally need the [.guihint]#Item (used in service description)# option,
which will insert your predefined text into the service's name.

If your event console is not running on the same {CMK}-instance that is monitoring
the host, you will need a remote access via TCP through [.guihint]#Access to Event Console#:

image::ec_check_remote.png[]

For this to function the event console must permit an access via TCP.
This can be configured in the settings of the EC that will be accessed:

image::ec_remote_access.png[]


[#archive]
== The Archive

=== Fundamentals of operation

The event console maintains a protocol of the changes that an event goes through.
This can be found via two precedures:

* In the global overview [.guihint]#Event Console => Recent event history#.
* In the details of an event using the [.guihint]#History of Event# button.

In the global overview a filter that only shows the events for the last
24 hours is used. As usual the filter can be customised.

The following image shows the history of event 5976, which experienced a
total of four changes. The event was initially generated (`NEW`),
then its state was manually changed from {OK} to {CRIT} (`CHANGESTATE`),
the event was then acknowledged and a comment was added (`UPDATE`),
and finally the event was archived/deleted (`DELETE`):

image::ec_history.png[]

The following types of entry are found in the archive:

[cols="20,~"]
|===
|Entry |Meaning 

|NEW |The event has been newly created (by a message, or by a rule which is missing an expected message).
|UPDATE |The event was edited by the operator (a change to comments, contact info, acknowledgement).
|DELETE |The event has been archived.
|CANCELLED |The event was automatically link:ec.html#cancelling[cancelled] following an OK-message.
|CHANGESTATE |The event's state was changed by the operator.
|ARCHIVED |The event has been automatically archived – since no rule was invoked, and the [.guihint]#Force message archiving# option was activated in the global settings.
|ORPHANED |The event was automatically archived as the applicable rule was deleted while the event was in the [.guihint]#counting# phase.
|COUNTREACHED |The event was changed from [.guihint]#counting# to [.guihint]#open# because the configured count of messages had been reached.
|COUNTFAILED |The event has been automatically archived because in the [.guihint]#counting# phase the required message count had not been reached.
|NOCOUNT |The event has been automatically archived because during the [.guihint]#counting# phase, the applicable rule has been altered so that it no longer counts the messages.
|DELAYOVER |The event was opened because the link:ec.html#delay[delay] configured in the rule has expired.
|EXPIRED |The event was automatically archived because its configured link:ec.html#expire[lifetime] had expired.
|EMAIL |An email has been sent.
|SCRIPT |An automatic action (script) has been executed.
|AUTODELETE |The event was automatically archived directly and immediately after opening because this action was configured in the applicable rule.
|===


=== Location of the archive

As mentioned at the beginning, the event console has not been conceived as a
comprehensive syslog archive. In order to make the implementation and
administration as simple as possible it does without a database backend.
Instead of this the archive is written as simple text data. Each entry consists
of a single line of text divided into columns by tabs. The file is located
in `var/mkeventd/history`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll var/mkeventd/history/
total 1328
-rw-rw-r-- 1 stable stable     131 Dez  4 23:59 1480633200.log
-rw-rw-r-- 1 stable stable 1123368 Dez  5 23:39 1480892400.log
-rw-rw-r-- 1 stable stable  219812 Dez  6 09:46 1480978800.log
----

By default a new file is opened every day. Its rotation can be customised
in link:ec.html#globalsettings[Settings for the EC].
The [.guihint]#Event history logfile rotation# setting enables the rotation to be
set to weekly.

The file's name corresponds to the Unix-timestamp from the time of the creation
of the file (Seconds since the 1.1.1970 UTC).

These files will be retained for 365 days, unless otherwise altered in the
[.guihint]#Event history lifetime# setting. The files will additionally be included
in {CMK}'s central disk space-management, which can be configured in the
global settings under [.guihint]#Site management#. The respective _shorter_ preset
time limit applies here. The global management has the advantage that if disk
space becomes tight, starting from the oldest records it can delete historic
data from all files in an *evenly distributed* manner.

If you run into space problems the files in the catalogue can be simply deleted
or moved to another location by hand. Do not however store zipped or any other
files in this catalogue.


=== Automatic archiving

Despite the limitations imposed by text files it is theoretically possible
to archive a great number of messages. The writing to the archive's text files
is very efficient – though at the cost of any subsequent searches.
Since the files have only the time range for the query as an index,
every query requires all relevant files to be read and searched sequentially.

The EC will normally only write those messages to the archive for which an
event was actually opened.
This function can be extended to _all_ events in two ways:

. Create a rule to match all other events, and in [.guihint]#Outcome & actions# activate the [.guihint]#Delete event immediately after the actions# option.
. In the link:ec.html#globalsettings[EC's global settings], activate the [.guihint]#Force message archiving# option.

This latter point ensures that messages to which no rule applies nonetheless
go to the archive (flagged as `ARCHIVED`).


[#tuning]
== Peformance and tuning

=== Processing of messages

Even in these days of servers with 64 bit cores and 2 TB main storage, software
performance still plays a role. Especially when processing events, in extreme
cases inadequate performance can lead to the loss of incoming messages.

The reason for this is that none of the protocols in use (Syslog, SNMP-Traps,
etc.) provide a flow control. If 1000 hosts simultaneously send a message every
second the recipient has no chance of coping with such a flow.

For this reason, in larger environments it is important to keep an eye on the
processing time for a message. This of course basically depends on how
many rules have been defined and how those rules have been constructed.

==== Measuring performance

For measuring performance there is a separate element for the
link:user_interface.html#sidebar[Side bar] named [.guihint]#Event Console Performance#.
This can be integrated as usual with icon:button_sidebar_addsnapin[]:

image::ec_performance.png[align=center, width=280]

The values shown here are mean values over the last minute or so.
An ‘event storm’ that only lasts a couple of seconds cannot be read directly
here, but in this way the numbers have been somewhat ‘smoothed’ and are thus
easier to read.

To test for the achievable maximum performance, a storm of unclassified messages
can be artificially generated (but please, only in a test system!),
in which for example, you can continuously code the contents of a text file as
a loop in a shell in the Events-Pipe:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} while true ; do cat /etc/services > tmp/run/mkeventd/events ; done
----

The performance values from the performance element have the following meanings:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|Wert |Meaning 

|[.guihint]#Received messages# |Count of the current incoming messages per second.
|[.guihint]#Rule hits# |The number of rules currently _being applied_ per second. These can also be rules that delete messages or simply only count. Thus not every rule match results in an event.
|[.guihint]#Rule tries# |The count of rules being tested. This provides valuable information on the efficiency of the rule chain – especially in conjunction with the following parameter:
|[.guihint]#Rule hit ratio# |The proportion of [.guihint]#Rule tries# to [.guihint]#Rule hits#. In other words – how many rules must the EC try before one (finally) applies. In the example shown in the screenshot the rate is questionably low.
|[.guihint]#Created events# |The count of events being generated each second. Because the event console should really only show _relevant problems_ (and is thus comparable to host and service problems in monitoring), in practice the number *3.77/s* in the illustration is of course far too high!
|[.guihint]#Processing time per message# |Here the time required for processing a message can be read. Attention: this is generally *not* the inverse of [.guihint]#Received messages# – since it doesn't include the times when the event console is idle when no messages are incoming. Here only the actual elapsed time required from the receipt of a message to the time its processing has finished is measured. In this you can roughly see the maximum number of messages that the EC _can_ process in a given time range. + + Please also note that this is not a measure of _CPU-time_, rather it is _real_ time. In a system with enough free CPUs these times will be around the same. But if the system is under such a load that not every process is allocated a CPU, then the real time can be noticibly longer.
|===


==== Tuning tips

The approximate number of messages the event console can process per second can be
be seen in [.guihint]#Processing time per message#. This time generally depends on how
many rules must be tested before a message can be processed.
There are a number of options for optimisation:

* Rules that exclude many messages should be placed at the front of the rule chain if possible
* Work with link:ec.html#rulepacks[rulepacks] to bundle related rules. The first rule in each pack should immediately exit the pack if the common basic condition is not satisfied

Furthermore, there is an optimisation in the EC based on the syslog priority
and facility. Here an internal rule chain will be constructed for every combination
of priority and facility, which will only include rules that are relevant to
messages in these combinations.

Any rule with a condition for priority or facility – or ideally both – will no
longer be included in ALL of the rule chains, rather for optimisation
in only a single rule chain. This means that the rule will not need to be
tested for messages with another syslog classification.

Following a restart an overview of all optimised rule chains will be
shown in `var/log/mkeventd.log`:

In the above example 67 rules can be seen that must be checked for every case.
For messages from the `daemon` facility there are 89 relevant rules,
and 120 rules must be checked only for the `daemon`/`emerg` combination.
Any rule that receives a condition for priority or facility reduces
the count by a further 67.

Of course these conditions can only be set if it is certain that they will also
be satisfied by the relevant messages!


=== Count of current events

The count of actual current events can also influence the EC's performance –
especially when they are clearly out of control. As already mentioned, the EC
should not be seen as a substitute for a syslog archive, rather to merely
display ‘ongoing problems’. The event console can in fact deal with several thousand
problems, but that is not really the point.

Once the count of current events exceeds around 5000, performance will become
noticibly degraded. On the one hand this will be seen in the GUI which will
respond more slowly to queries – and on the other hand the processing will also
slow down, since in some cases messages must be compared against all active events.
Memory consumption can also be problematic.

For performance reasons the event console alsways holds all active events in RAM.
These will be logged once per minute (customisable), and at clean completion, in the
`var/mkeventd/status` file.
If this file becomes very large (e.g. over 50 megabytes), this procedure will
likewise continue slowing down. The actual size can be quickly checked with `ll` (alias for `ls -alF`):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} ll -h var/mkeventd/status
-rw-r--r-- 1 mysite mysite [hilite]#386K# Dez 14 13:46 var/mkeventd/status
----

If due to a clumsy rule (e.g., a rule that matches everything) far too many current
events are generated, manual deletions via the GUI are quite impractical.
In such a situation simply deleting the status file helps:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd stop mkeventd
Stopping mkeventd...killing 17436......OK
{c-omd} rm var/mkeventd/status
{c-omd} omd start mkeventd
Starting mkeventd (builtin: syslog-udp)...OK
----


*Attention*: Naturally _all_ current events will be lost, likewise
the stored rule counts and other states.
In particular, new events will begin again with the ID 1.


[#overflow]
==== Automatic overflow protection

From Version VERSION[1.4.0i2] the event console has an automatic protection
against ‘flooding’. This limits the number of current events per host, per rule,
and globally. In this way not only are open events counted, but also those in other
phases, such as, for example, [.guihint]#delayed# or [.guihint]#counting#.
Archived events are not counted.

This protects you in situations in which, due to a systemic problem in the
network, thousands of critical events could stream in and ‘jam’ the event console.
On the one hand this averts a performance breakdown in the event console while
it tries to contain too many events in main memory – on the other hand the
overview remains (just) manageable for the operator, and events that are not a
part of the storm remain visible.


Once a limit has been reached, one of the following actions will take place:

* The creation of new events will be stopped (for this host, this rule, or globally)
* Like the preceeding, but an ‘overflow event’ will also be generated
* Like the preceeding, but an appropriate contact person will also be notified
* Alternatively to the preceeding three options, you can allow the respective oldest event to be deleted in order to make space for a newer


The limits, and likewise the associated consequence of a limit being reached
can be set in [.guihint]#Generic => Limit amount of current events#.
The following image shows the default setting:

image::ec_limit_open_events.jpg[]

If you have activated the [.guihint]#create overflow event# option, when the limit has
been reached _an artificial_ event will be generated which will inform the
operator of the error situation:

image::ec_overflow_event.png[]

If you have additionally activated the [.guihint]#notify contacts...# option,
relevant contact personnel will be notified via {CMK}-Alarm.
The notification runs through {CMK}'s link:notifications.html[notification rules].
These rules do not absolutely have to use the exact contact selection specified
in the event console, but they can modify it. The following table shows which
contacts will be selected if you have set the
[.guihint]#Notify all contacts of the notified host or service# option (the default):


[cols="15,~"]
|===
|Limit |Contact list 

|per Host |The host contacts, which are identified in exactly the same way as with the link:ec.html#notifications[notification of events] in {CMK}.
|per Rule |Here the field for the host name will be left empty. If the rule defines contact groups, these will be selected – otherwise the fallback- contacts will apply.
|Global |The fallback-contacts.
|===



=== Archive too large


As shown link:ec.html#archive[above] the event console has an archive of all events and
their processing steps. For reasons of simple implementation and administration
these are stored as simple text files.

Text files are unbeatable for performance when it comes to the _writing_
of data – not even by the world's fastest database. This is due to,
among other factors, the optimisation of this type of access through Linux, and
the complete storage hierarchy of hard drives and SANs. This is however to the
detriment of the read access – since text files have no indexes, searching in the
files requires the complete file to be read.

As an index the event console at least uses the log file's name for the _time_ of
the event. The narrower the time range for the query, the faster the search can be
processed.

It is nonetheless very important that the archive doesn't get too large.
If you simply use the event console to process genuine error messages,
this can't really happen. But if it is used as a substitute for a real syslog
archive, it can certainly result in a very large file being produced.

If you find yourself in the situation in which the archive has gotten too large,
you can simply delete older files in `var/mkeventd/history/`.
You can also apply a general limit to data lifetimes in [.guihint]#Event history lifetime#,
thus predefining future deletions. By default the data will be saved for
365 days. You may well get by with much less.


=== Measuring performance over time

From Version VERSION[1.4.0], for every active instance on the event
console {CMK} automatically provides a new service which displays the
performance data in curves, and which also warns of link:ec.html#overflow[overflow].

As long as at least one Linux agent of this version is installed on the
monitoring core itself, the Check will be automatically found and set up as usual:

image::ec_check.png[]


The Check provides very many interesting performance data, for example, the count
of incoming messages over a time range, and how many of these are discarded:

image::ec_graph_message_rate.png[align=center, width=550]


The efficiency of your rule chain will be displayed through a comparison of
rules tested with those that have taken effect:

image::ec_graph_rule_efficiency.png[align=center, width=550]

This graph shows the average time for processing a message:

image::ec_graph_processing_time.png[align=center, width=550]


As well as those shown here, there are numerous further diagrams.



== Distributed monitoring


How to implement the event console in an installation with multiple
{CMK}-instances can be learned about in the
link:distributed_monitoring.html#ec[article on distributed monitoring].



== The status interface

Via the `tmp/run/mkeventd/status` Unix-Socket, as well as access to the
internal status, the event console enables the execution of commands.
The protocol used here is a greatly-restricted subset of link:livestatus.html[Livestatus].

Up until Version VERSION[1.2.8] the link:user_interface.html[GUI] used this socket
to display the open and archived events, and to execute commands on events.
From Version VERSION[1.4.0] the monitoring core acts as a substitute on
the interface, and passes the data to the GUI to make both a
link:distributed_monitoring.html[distributed monitoring] and the event console possible.



The following restrictions apply to the event console's simplified live status:

* The only permitted headers are `Filter:` and `OutputFormat:`.
* For this reason keep alive is not possible. Only a single query per connection is possible.


The following tables are available:

[cols=2]
|===

|events |List of all current events
|history |Access to the link:ec.html#archive[archive]. A query to this table directs to an access of the archive's text data. Definitely use a filter for the time range of the desired entry to avoid a full accessing all of the files.
|status |Status and performance data for the EC. This table always has exactly one line.
|===



With the help of `unixcat` commands can be written to the socket using a very simple syntax:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} echo "COMMAND RELOAD" | unixcat tmp/run/mkeventd/status
----


The following commands are available:

[cols=2]
|===

|DELETE |Archives an event. Argument: Event-ID and username.
|RELOAD |Refreshes the configuration
|SHUTDOWN |Shuts the event console down
|REOPENLOG |Reopens the Log file. This command is required by the Log file rotation.
|FLUSH |Deletes all current and archived events!
|SYNC |Initiates an immediate update of the `var/mkeventd/status` file.
|RESETCOUNTERS |Resets the hits counters (corresponds to the icon:context_button_reset_counters[] button in WATO.
|UPDATE |Updates an event. The arguments are in the sequence – event-ID, user-ID, acknowledgement (0/1), comments, contact info.
|CHANGESTATE |Changes the states {OK} / {WARN} / {CRIT} / {UNKNOWN} for an event. Arguments are event-ID, user-ID and state number (`0`/`1`/`2`/`3`)
|ACTION |Executes a user-defined action on an event. Arguments are event-ID, user-ID and actions-ID. The special `@NOTIFY` ID corresponds to a link:ec.html#notifications[notification] over {CMK}.
|===



== Files and directories

[cols="50,~"]
|===
|File path |Meaning 

|var/mkeventd |The Event-Daemon's working directory
|var/mkeventd/status |The complete current state of the event console. This primarily includes all current open events (and those intermediate states like  [.guihint]#counting#..). In the case of a configuration error that produces very many open events this file can be huge and it can drastically reduce the EC's performance. In such a case you can stop the `mkeventd` service, delete the file, and restart the service, in order to delete all open events with one action.
|var/mkeventd/history/ |The link:ec.html#archive[EC-Archive's] storage location
|etc/check_mk/mkeventd.d/wato/global.mk |WATO stores the event console's global settings in Python-syntax.
|etc/check_mk/mkeventd.d/wato/rules.mk |All of your configured rule packs and rules in Python-syntax.
|tmp/run/mkeventd/events |A Named-Pipe in which with `echo` or other commands you can write messages directly in order to pass them to the EC. Please ensure that only a single application writes in this pipe at any point in time, otherwise the messages' texts can become mixed together.
|tmp/run/mkeventd/eventsocket |A Unix-socket that performs the same function as the pipe, but which makes simultaneous writing by multiple applications possible. To write to it the `unixcat` or `socat` commands are needed.
|tmp/run/mkeventd/pid |The current process-ID of the event daemon when it is running.
|tmp/run/mkeventd/status |A Unix-socket that enables the querying of the current state, and the sending of commands. Up to {CMK} Version VERSION[1.2.8] the GUI uses this socket to display the views and the execution of commands. From Version VERSION[1.4.0i2] the GUI's queries go to the monitoring core which then connects itself to the socket.
|local/share/snmp/mibs |Your uploaded MIB-files for the translation of SNMP-traps
