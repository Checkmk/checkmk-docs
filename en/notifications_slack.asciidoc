== Function

With the link:https://slack.com/[Slack^] messenger you can conveniently receive notifications via a webhook.
This works on self-hosted or rented servers, as well as via the free public Slack service.


== Configuring Slack

To activate webhooks and create a new webhook, you must first create a Slack app.
Log in to Slack and create a _Workspace._ Then proceed as follows:

. Create a new app via link:https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks[this link^] using the Slack API.
. Assign any name you like and choose your workspace.
. In the next dialog choose [.guihint]#Incoming Webhook# as the app function.
. Next activate webhooks by setting the switch to [.guihint]#on#.
. Create the webhook with the [.guihint]#Add New Webhook to Workspace# button.
. Finally, set the channel (group) where the app should post to, and confirm the rights request.

For testing purposes, on completion you will receive a `curl` statement which posts _Hello World_ to the desired channel.
Copy the webhook URL and switch to {CMK}.


== Configuration in {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article about xref:notifications#[notifications].

As a reminder:

The configuration in {CMK} requires now only the specification of the webhook URL copied above:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Slack or Mattermost#.
. Enter the copied webhook URL.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI within the notification.
Instead of specifying the webhook URL directly here, you can also use {CMK}'s password store and read the URL from one of its entries.

For testing you can use the [.guihint]#Fake check results# and [.guihint]#Custom notification# xref:commands#[commands].
