:title: Managing licenses - collect and send license information
:description: Use this to collect and send transparent information about the current license status in {CMK} while maintaining full control over data transmission.


== Introduction

{cee-only} If you use one of the {CEE}, you perform a license audit at least once a year, i.e. you create an overview of the use of {CMK} within your company and pass it on to tribe29.
While {CMK} can't do this administrative work for you entirely, it can make the process a lot easier.

{CMK} collects the current service numbers for all connected sites at a random time every day.
These are then displayed clearly and transparently in the license usage view.

{CMK} stores this information continuously for a period of 400 days, but never transmits it automatically.
Older data is removed.

As an administrator of {CMK}, you then have the license usage information conveniently transmitted directly from {CMK} to the tribe29 customer portal.
If this is not possible for you, you can actively download the information and then manually upload it to the customer portal.
In any case, you retain full control over the data transfer and the transmitted content.


==  Using license management

[#generate_application_password]
=== Retrieving subscription data from the customer portal

Go to the link:https://portal.checkmk.com/[{CMK} customer portal^].
Log in there with your access data to create the [.guihint]#Application Account Credentials#, which you will need to enter into {CMK} in the xref:setup[next step].

Select your subscription.
The view will then look like this, for example:

image::license_subscription.png[alt="License subscription in the customer portal.", width=95%]

Now click [.guihint]#Generate Application Account Password# to create the password for the submission.

image::license_generate_password.png[alt="Creating a password in the customer portal.", width=68%]

Copy the [.guihint]#Application Account# and the [.guihint]#Password# and close this window with [.guihint]#Confirm#.


[#setup]
=== Entering subscription data in {CMK}

As xref:wato_user#roles[{CMK} administrator] open [.guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > License usage#.
This page will be empty as long as no subscription data has been stored.

image::license_license_usage_ausschnitt.png[alt="The Edit subscription settings button to open the subscription settings page."]

Use the [.guihint]#Edit subscription settings# button to open the page with this same name:

image::license_edit_subscription.png[alt="Form for entering subscription settings."]

Now enter the start and end dates for your current subscription period in the corresponding fields in the [guihint]#Subscription details# section.
Below that, select one of the default subscription values.
Alternatively, you can use the [.guihint]#Custom limit# selection to enter your own value if the one that applies to your environment is not provided.

Fill in the [.guihint]#Application account credentials# section with the xref:generate_application_password[information from the customer portal].
Make sure to use the [.guihint]#Application account# as the [.guihint]#Username#.

Finally, click [.guihint]#Save# to store your information.


=== Displaying license information

{CMK} will now start to display the license related information in the form of a colored diagram.

When license management has been running for a while, you will see a graph of this type:

image::license_usage.png[alt="Graphic overview of the current license usage."]

Based on the various colored elements, you will be able to understand the following:

* The red line shows the license limit currently entered in the [.guihint]#xref:setup[Subscription details]#.
This makes it easy to see if the number of services has been exceeded.
* The light blue line shows the average number of services per month.
This smooths out peaks caused by a misconfiguration, for example.
* The dark blue line shows for each day the total number of monitored services across all connected sites.
* The green column shows the average number of services in the current month.
* The yellow column shows the first month in which the license limit has been exceeded.
* The purple column shows the month with the highest license overrun.

In a table below the graph, i.e. below the section shown above, the individual usage for each site per day is listed.


== Sending license information to tribe29

As a user of {CEE}, you can let {CMK} do most of the work of submitting your license information automatically.
You will only have to submit the data manually if this automated option is not possible in your organization.

Your license information is always available for display.
The information you see on the [.guihint]#License usage# and [guihint]#Edit subscription settings# pages will be used, as well as a comment added on the [.guihint]#Submit or download license usage report# page, if applicable.


[#directtrans]
=== Direct transmission by {CMK}

The [.guihint]#Application account credentials# must have been deposited in {CMK} before the first transfer (see xref:setup[Entering subscription data in {CMK}]).

On the [.guihint]#Submit or download license usage report# page, click the icon:icon_assume_0[alt="Icon to trigger transfer or download of license data."] [.guihint]#Submit report# button.

image::license_submit_report.png[alt="The 'Submit report' button."]

Your license information will then be transferred directly to your area of the {CMK} customer portal and you will receive a corresponding confirmation.

image::license_submit_license_success.png[alt="Confirmation of successful license data transmission."]


[#manualtrans]
=== Manual transmission

If you are in the situation of being required to upload your license information manually to the customer portal, proceed as follows:

To do this, open [guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > License usage#.
Then click on the icon:icon_assume_0[alt="Icon to initiate transfer or download of license data."] [.guihint]#Submit or download# button.

image::license_license_usage_ausschnitt2.png[alt="Selecting the 'Submit or download' button on the 'License usage' page."]

This will take you to the [.guihint]#Submit or download license usage report# page.

image::license_submit_or_download.png[alt="Submit or download license information page."]

With the icon:icon_download[alt="Icon for downloading the data."] [.guihint]#Download report# button, after specifying the desired path, start downloading the archive (a zipped tar archive).

Now exit {CMK} and go to the link:https://portal.checkmk.com/[{CMK} customer portal^].
Log in there with your access data to upload the license information.
Select the subscription for which you want to upload the license information.
Determine [.guihint]#Application Account# and [.guihint]#Password# for the transfer xref:generate_application_password[as described above].

Then open the license report transfer dialog with [.guihint]#Submit License Report#:

image::license_submit_license.png[alt="License report transfer dialog.", width=68%]

Add the [.guihint]#Application Account# and its associated [.guihint]#Password# and specify the file path to the license report.
Start the transfer with [.guihint]#Submit#.
Following a successful transfer, you will see a confirmation.

currently not required:
=== Supplementary information for tribe29 partners

As a tribe29 partner you can not only report your own license information easily and quickly to tribe29, but also the license information from your customers.
The xref:directtrans[direct transmission] of the customer-related information corresponds exactly to the procedure described above.
Only for the manual transmission are there some minor differences.

If you have direct access to {CMK} at your customer's site, create the license information file as described in the xref:manualtrans[Manual transmission] section.

If you do not have direct access to {CMK} at your customer's site, ask them to download it for you locally and send the resulting file to you.

Afterwards log in to the link:https://portal.checkmk.com/[{CMK} customer portal^] with your access data (additional options are available to tribe29 partners here).
Select [guihint]#Resold licenses# in the menu on the left sidebar.

image::license_resold_licenses.png[alt="Extended left side menu in the customer portal.", width=35%]

The [guihint]#Resold Licenses# window will open.

image::license_resold_licenses_rechts.png[alt="View all related end user licenses in the partner portal."]

Click the icon:button_upload_audit[alt="Button that opens the page for uploading the license information."] button in the line for the corresponding {CMK} customer.

Then, analogous to the procedure described above, define the license information file and start uploading the file by clicking the [guihint]#Upload license audit# button.
The successful upload is finally confirmed.
