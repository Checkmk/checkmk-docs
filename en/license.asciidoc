:title: Managing licenses - collect and send license information
:description: Use this to collect and send transparent information about the current license status in {CMK} while maintaining full control over data transmission.


== Introduction

{cee-only} If you use the {CSE} or the {CME}, you perform a license audit at least once a year, i.e. you create an overview of the licenses used by your company and pass it on to tribe29 or the tribe29 partner supporting you.
While {CMK} can't do this administrative work for you entirely, it can make it a lot easier.

{CMK} collects the current service numbers for all connected sites at a random time every day.
These are then displayed clearly and transparently in the license usage view.

{CMK} stores this information continuously for a period of 400 days, but never transmits it automatically.
Older data is removed.

As a {CMK} administrator you can actively download the license information and then manually upload it to the tribe29 customer portal.
A convenient alternative is to have {CMK} submit it directly to tribe29's customer portal.
In any case, you retain full control over the data transfer and the transferred content.


==  Using license management

[#setup]
=== Entering subscription data

As {CMK} user with xref:wato_user#roles[administrator rights] open [.guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > License usage#.
This page will be empty as long as no subscription data has been stored.

image::license_license_usage_ausschnitt.png[alt="Edit subscription settings button to open the subscription settings page."]

Use the [.guihint]#Edit subscription settings# button to open the page with this same name:

image::license_edit_subscription.png[alt="Form for entering subscription settings."]

Now enter the start and end dates for your current subscription period in the corresponding fields in the [guihint]#Subscription details# section.
Below that, select one of the default subscription values.
Alternatively, you can use the [.guihint]#Custom limit# selection to enter your own value if the one that applies to your environment is not provided.

If you want to use the xref:directtrans[direct transmission of license information], fill in the second section [.guihint]#Customer portal credentials# with your user name and password for the link:https://customer.checkmk.com/[{CMK} customer portal^].


=== Displaying license information

{CMK} will now start to display the license related information in the form of a colored diagram.

When license management has been running for a while, you will see a graph of this type:

image::license_usage.png[alt="Graphic overview of the current license usage."]

Based on the various colored elements, you will be able to understand the following:

* The red line shows the license limit currently entered in the [.guihint]#xref:setup[Subscription details]#.
This makes it easy to see if the number of services has been exceeded.
* The light blue line shows the average number of services per month.
This smoothes out peaks caused by a misconfiguration, for example.
* The dark blue line shows for each day the total number of monitored services across all connected sites.
* The green column shows the average number of services in the current month.
* The yellow column shows the first month in which the license limit has been exceeded.
* The purple column shows the month with the highest license overrun.

In a table below the graph, i.e. below the section shown above, the most recent license survey cases are listed individually.


== Sending license information to tribe29

As a {CSE} or {CME} user, you can either submit your license information manually or let {CMK} do most of the work.

Your license information is transparent to you at all times.
The information you see on the [.guihint]#License usage# and [guihint]#Edit subscription settings# pages will be used, as well as a comment added on the [.guihint]#Submit or download license usage report# page, if applicable.


[#manualtrans]
=== Manual transmission

You can download your license information directly and upload it manually to the tribe29 customer portal.

To do this, open [guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > License usage#.
Then click on the icon:icon_assume_0[alt="Icon to initiate transfer or download of license data."] [.guihint]#Submit or download# button.

image::license_license_usage_ausschnitt2.png[alt="Selecting the 'Submit or Download' button on the 'License Usage' page."]

This will take you to the [.guihint]#Submit or download license usage report# page.

image::license_submit_or_download.png[alt="Submit and download license information page."]

With the icon:icon_download[alt="Icon for downloading the data."] [.guihint]#Download report# button, after specifying the desired path, start downloading the archive (zipped tar archive).
It will include a JSON file that contains all of the license information that you see on the [guihint]#License usage# page.

Now exit {CMK} and go to the link:https://customer.checkmk.com/[{CMK} customer portal^].
Log in there with your credentials to upload the license information.
Select [.guihint]#License Audit# in the left sidebar.

image::license_license_audit.png[alt="Left side menu in the customer portal.", width=35%]

The [.guihint]#License Audit Upload# window will open, where you drag-and-drop the license information file into the gray field.
Alternatively, click in this field to open a browser window for selecting the file.

image::license_audit_upload_customer.png[alt="License information submission page in the customer portal."]

Enter your password and start the file transfer by clicking the [.guihint]#Upload license audit# button.
A successful upload will be confirmed at completion.


[#directtrans]
=== Direct transmission by {CMK}

To simplify your work even more, you can predefine the transmission of the license information.
This can be accomplished directly from {CMK} with just a few clicks.

*Note:* Your access data for the tribe29 customer portal must have been stored in {CMK} before the first transmission (see xref:setup[Entering subscription data]).

On the [.guihint]#Submit or download license usage report# page, use the icon:icon_assume_0[alt="Button to initiate transfer or download of license data."] [.guihint]#Submit report# button.
Your license information will then be transferred directly to your account area of the tribe29 customer portal and you will receive a corresponding confirmation.
The file transferred here is identical to the one you receive when downloading manually.

=== Supplementary information for tribe29 partners

As a tribe29 partner you can not only report your own license information easily and quickly to tribe29, but also the license information from your customers.
The xref:directtrans[direct transmission] of the customer-related information corresponds exactly to the procedure described above.
Only for the manual transmission are there some minor differences.

If you have direct access to {CMK} at your customer's site, create the license information file as described in the xref:manualtrans[Manual transmission] section.

If you do not have direct access to {CMK} at your customer's site, ask them to download it for you and have the file sent to you.

Afterwards log in to the link:https://customer.checkmk.com/[{CMK} customer portal^] with your access data (additional options are available to tribe29 partners here).
Select [guihint]#Resold licenses# in the menu on the left sidebar.

image::license_resold_licenses.png[alt="Extended left side menu in the customer portal.", width=35%]

The [guihint]#Resold Licenses# window will open.

image::license_resold_licenses_rechts.png[alt="View all related end user licenses in the partner portal."]

Click the icon:button_upload_audit[alt="Button that opens the page for uploading the license information."] button in the line for the corresponding {CMK} customer.

Then, analogous to the procedure described above, define the license information file and start uploading the file by clicking the [guihint]#Upload license audit# button.
The successful upload is finally confirmed.
