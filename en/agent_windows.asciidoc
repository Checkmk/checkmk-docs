== Introduction

The monitoring of Windows servers was one of the first important tasks for {CMK}.
As for all other server operating systems {CMK} therefore also provides its own
agent for monitoring Windows.
Compared to monitoring with WMI or SNMP this has several benefits -- {CMK} is:

* *minimalist*, since it uses minimal resources of RAM, CPU and network.
* *secure*, because it does not read data from the network. This prevents any external access to the system.
* *comprehensive*, because it has access to vital data that is not accessible via WMI or SNMP.
* *easily extendable*, because you can write extensions in any programming or scripting language.
* *open*, because even though the agent is delivered as an executable file, you always have access to the source code, and you can in principle also compile the agent yourself, and have access to the functionality at any time. No unknown code is used.

The installation and setup of the agent is very simple and has only a few steps,
because, for example, to function it needs no additional libraries.
{CMK} is also delivered with a basic configuration which is sufficient for most
applications.

In operation the agent consists of a Windows service which starts the supplied
program -- the agent. When invoked this agent collects data from the local system
and provides it to the monitoring through port 6556,
in the same way as other agents.

In the {CEE} you can centrally-update and configure the agent automatically
using the xref:agent_deployment#[automatic agent updates]. Alternatively you can also
distribute the MSI package in other ways, such as with the Microsoft Active
directory.
The installation can here be fully-automated through the MSI format.

For compatibility reasons, only the major versions of Windows are supported.
The following table lists these specifically:

[cols=2]
|===
|Version |Edition

|NT 6.0 |Windows Vista
|NT 6.0 |Windows Server 2008
|NT 6.1 |Windows 7
|NT 6.1 |Windows 2008 R2
|NT 6.2 |Windows 8
|NT 6.2 |Windows Server 2012
|NT 6.3 |Windows 8.1
|NT 6.3 |Windows 2012 R2
|NT 6.4 / NT 10.0 |Windows 10
|NT 6.4 / NT 10.0 |Windows Server 2016
|NT 6.4 / NT 10.0 |Windows Server 2019
|===


*Important*: editions that are not listed in the above table are not
officially supported. This includes, for example, _Windows Embedded_.


== Installing the agent

=== Various installation options

{CMK} offers several ways to install the Windows Agent -- from a manual
installation of the individual components, up to a fully-automatic deployment.
Some of these possibilities are only available in the {CEE}:

[cols="40,50,~,~"]
|===
|Method |Description |CRE |CEE 

|Supplied MSI package |Easy installation of a standard agent with manual configuration via configuration files. |X |X
|MSI package from the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery] |Configuration over the GUI -- an individual configuration of each host is possible. | |X
|xref:agent_deployment#[Automatic Updates] |The package from the Agent Bakery is first installed by hand or by script, and automatically-updated from then on. | |X
|===


=== Installation via an MSI package

Regardless of whether you create the MSI packages over the
xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery], or configure them manually on each
host -- you first need the installation file.
In the {CRE} you go via [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows#
to the [.guihint]#Packaged Agents#. Here you will find the [.guihint]#check_mk_agent.msi# file.

image::agent_windows_packaged_agents.png[width=60%]

In the {EE} you find the baked agent packages via [.guihint]#Setup > Agents >
Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX#. In order to download the installer, simply click the icon in the column [.guihint]#Windows#.

image::agent_windows_packaged_agents_bakery.png[]

Download the MSI file to the host and start the installation.
In principle, you just have to follow the menu, and read and agree to the
[.guihint]#GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE# license terms.

After installation the agent will be started immediately as a Windows service,
and be ready to monitor the system.


==== Unattended installation

Windows provides the ability to automate installations of MSI packages
via `msiexec`.
An automated installation might look like this, for example:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Users\hhirsch\Downloads\> msiexec /i check_mk_agent.msi /qn
----

In this case the agent will be installed under the default file path, and then immediately started as a Windows service.
This method is therefore ideal for automatic agent roll outs on many hosts.

You can also use this method to modify the three options you see in the screenshot in the section xref:agent_windows.html#_migration_to_the_new_standard_agent[Migration to the new standard agent].
To enable an option append its identifier followed by an equal sign:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Users\hhirsch\Downloads\> msiexec /i check_mk_agent.msi /qn WIXUI_CLEANINSTALL=
----

To explicitly disable one of the options, you need to add two double quotes after the equal sign:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Users\hhirsch\Downloads\> msiexec /i check_mk_agent.msi /qn WIXUI_MIGRATELEGACY=""
----

[cols="80,~"]
|===
|Option in the graphical installer | Identifier

| Clean installation| WIXUI_CLEANINSTALL
| Remove Legacy Windows Agent (pre 1.6) if present| WIXUI_REMOVELEGACY
| Migrate from Legacy Windows Agent (pre 1.6) configuration if present| WIXUI_MIGRATELEGACY
|===





[#firewall]
==== Windows Firewall

The agent already creates a rule in the Windows firewall when it is installed so that it can be reached from the outside via port 6556.
However, if you receive no information at all or only error messages about timeouts during xref:wato_services#discovery[service discovery] or during a xref:wato_monitoringagents#diagnosticpage[connection test] to the host, you should check the [.guihint]#Inbound Rules# of the Windows firewall on the host.

.Possible output of _Test connection to host_.
image::agent_windows_communication_failed.png[alt="Error message from an unreachable agent.",width=64%]

In current versions of Windows you can find [.guihint]#Windows Firewall with Advanced Security# via the Windows [.guihint]#Settings# or start it by calling `wf.msc` from the command line.

image::agent_windows_windows_firewall.png[]

If you do not find such an entry in the Windows Firewall settings, you can add it at this point specifically.
To do this, click [.guihint]#New Rule# in the [.guihint]#Action# menu.

This opens a wizard for creating a new firewall rule.
Set the five selection options as follows:

[cols="15,~"]
|====
|[.guihint]#Rule Type# |Leave the selection here at [.guihint]#Program#.
|[.guihint]#Program# |Enter [.guihint]#This program path# `%ProgramFiles% (x86)\checkmk\service\check_mk_agent.exe` or use the [.guihint]#Browse# button to select the `check_mk_agent.exe` file.
|[.guihint]#Action# |Leave the selection at [.guihint]#Allow the connection#.
|[.guihint]#Profile# |This point depends heavily on the configuration of your network. However, in most cases it is recommended to enable only [.guihint]#Domain# and [.guihint]#Private# here.
|[.guihint]#Name# |Give the rule a concise and short name.
|====

Alternatively, you can also automate this step and set the rule directly on the command line. 
If necessary customize the following command to your custom installation path:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Windows\System32> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Check_MK" ^
description="Monitoring" dir=in localport=6556 protocol=tcp action=allow ^
program="%ProgramFiles(x86)%\checkmk\service\check_mk_agent.exe" ^
profile=private,domain enable=yes
OK.
----

*Note*: The command here has been split into four lines for readability.


=== Installation using the Agent Bakery

{cee-only}
For the agent on Windows the {CEE} also have  the possibility of configuring it individually via the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery] using the [.guihint]#Setup# menu.
For a detailed description see the general chapter on the xref:wato_monitoringagents#[agents].
Again, the installation of the baked MSI package is performed exactly as described above.


=== Automatic updates

{cee-only}
If you use the Agent Bakery you can set up automatic updates for the agent.
This is described in its xref:agent_deployment#[own article].


[#agent_architecture]
== Architecture of the agent

=== The agent’s directories

The agent is divided over two parts of the file system:

* `C:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service\` - Program-specific files are installed here. Customization is not necessary. The path `Program Files *(x86)*` is used for compatibility reasons, and is independent of whether the agent is to be installed on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.
The installation routine automatically selects the right agent.
* `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\` - Host-specific files are stored here. The behavior of the agent is configured here, and plug-ins, logs, etc., are also stored in this directory. +
*Note*: This directory is normally marked as invisible by the system.


=== The agent’s configuration files

For the agent configuration, three files are read sequentially and hierarchically:

. `C:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service\check_mk.yml` - The default configuration is stored here. You must not change these.
. `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\bakery\check_mk.bakery.yml` - This file is created by the Agent Bakery, and it may override a default value from the previous file.
. `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml` - In this file you can make manual customizations to test a setting or extension on a host. This file is read in from the Agent Bakery after configuration, and overwrites it if necessary.

As you may already have recognised by the of the configuration files’ file
extension, link:https://yaml.org[YAML] is used for the configuration
format. We decided, starting from version {v16}, that this format makes
it easier to use structured data than with the classic INI format.

For the manual work with the agent, only the last configuration file
(`check_mk.user.yaml`) is relevant, because it is the last to be read in
and thus _it has the last word_. If the Agent Bakery is not used, this is
in fact the only file in which customization of the agent’s configuration
may be made.


[#legacy]
== Installing the old agent

=== Why a second agent?

In earlier versions of {CMK} the agent had a different architecture.
This has been working well for a long time, and from Version {v16} it
has been replaced by a new one in order to tidy up loose ends, to simplify the
configuration, and ultimately to have better tools on hand -- for example for
help in being better able to track down configuration errors.

For compatibility reasons the old agent is still included in {CMK} because only
it can reliably monitor old platforms like Windows XP and Windows 2003.
These two systems will no longer be supported by the new agent.
In addition, having an already-installed old agent should make a migration to
the current one easier. This is still compatible with {CMK}, so that an update
of your {CMK} server to Version {v16} does not automatically require
an agent update.


=== Special features of the agent up to Version {v15}

The new Windows agent differs from the old agent in the following points:

* Different usage of directories. In the old agent the installation directory and the configuration directory are the same. Only the `C:\Program Files (x86)\check_mk\` directory will be used.
* As a result the available plug-ins are not automatically installed, but must be individually downloaded from the {CMK} server and correctly stored.
* In the old agent the configuration is recorded in an initialization file (`check_mk.ini`). The default configuration and the Agent Bakery use this identical file. Local customizations can be made using the `check_mk_local.ini` file, which must be in the same directory.
* The possibilities for going deeper into the agent are very limited.


=== Migrating to the new standard agent

Migration from an already-installed agent to the current agent is very simple.
Simply call the installation package for the new agent (`check_mk_agent.msi`), and follow the instructions as usual.
During the installation you will always be asked how to handle old configuration files:

image::agent_windows_install_agent_product_features.png[width=77%]

The old agent will then only be stopped and be disabled.
Regardless, the configuration of the old agent will, as a part of the
installation process, be transferred to the new format and stored as a user
configuration (`check_mk.user.yml`). This gives you the option of
checking the conversion with the aid of the original file. Once you are sure the
conversion was successful, you can deinstall the old agent.

You would probably only want to make such a manual check of individual hosts in
a group. Once you are sure that the conversion works correctly, you can
accordingly deinstall the old agent automatically. You will then save yourself
the manual deinstallation, and can simply replace the old agent with the new one.

*Important*: After you have removed the old agent, its directory may not
have been completely deleted. This is not an error, but a normal behavior if
there are files in the directory to be deleted that were not brought into the
system via the installation routine. These could be plug-ins or your own
configuration files which were created manually by a user.
In such cases, simply delete the old agent’s installation directory following
the deinstallation after making sure that it contains no important files.


==== Adapting firewall rules for the new agent

If you do not make a fresh install of the standard agent and are instead
migrating from the legacy agent, you may need to adapt your existing
firewall rule. You don’t need to add a new rule as described
xref:agent_windows#firewall[above] however, instead you can simply modify your existing rule and point it to the new agent. We will assume in the following example that your rule is called ‘Check_MK’:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Windows\System32> netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Check_MK" ^
new program="%ProgramFiles(x86)%\checkmk\service\check_mk_agent.exe"

Updated 1 rule(s).
Ok.
----

If the program `netsh` found the specified rule, you will get the
result as you can see it in the example output.
But if you don’t know -- or cannot remember -- your rule’s name,
use the graphical tool `wf.msc` instead.



[#testing]
== Testing and fault diagnosis

=== Checking the configuration

To check if the configuration was read in as you expected, call the agent with
the `showconfig` option. With this option you not only get an output of
the configuration as it is currently being used by the agent -- the environment
variables in use, as well as the configuration files will always be shown.

If only a certain part of the configuration is of interest, restrict the output
to a specific part. Here, for example, it is being checked whether the options for the `ps` section have been defined correctly:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Program Files x86\checkmk\service> .\check_mk_agent.exe showconfig ps
# Environment Variables:
# MK_LOCALDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\local"
# MK_STATEDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\state"
# MK_PLUGINSDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins"
# MK_TEMPDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\tmp"
# MK_LOGDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\log"
# MK_CONFDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config"
# MK_SPOOLDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\spool"
# MK_INSTALLDIR="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\install"
# MK_MSI_PATH="C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\update"
# Loaded Config Files:
# system: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service\check_mk.yml'
# bakery: 'C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\bakery'
# user  : 'C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml'

# ps
enabled: yes
use_wmi: yes
full_path: no
----

In this way you can get a quick overview of how the three different configuration
files are merged and used by the agent. Errors are thus immediately visible.


=== Testing the agent

There are several methods under Windows to test the agent’s functionality.
With the `help` option you will get a detailed overview of which
diagnostic options the agent provides.
The most important of these are presented here.


==== Local testing

Use the `test` option to directly run the agent locally and see
immediately if an output can be generated without errors. To save space only the
first lines of output are shown in the example here:

[{shell-raw}]

==== Testing from the monitoring server

If a problem does not exist locally, with the `-io` option you have
another way of checking the agent from outside. This option starts the agent as a
short-term service, and then logs every connection made to this service from
outside.
In this way you can verify if a request really has reached the host.
Note that for this test to work the agent’s Windows service must not be
running -- therefore stop the service before carrying out the test:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Program Files x86\checkmk\service> .\check_mk_agent.exe check -io
testing 10 seconds
Starting IO ipv6:false, used port:6556
Connected from '192.168.42.1' ipv6 :false -> queue
Put on queue, size is [1]
Found connection on queue, in queue left[0]
Connected from '192.168.42.1' ipv6:false <- queue
No data to send
Shutting down IO...
Stopping execution
Exiting process queue
cma::world::ExternalPort::ioThreadProc:  terminated from outside
IO ends...
----

Possible errors are also logged in this test, so in the case of an error you can
more easily find out where to look for the cause of the problem.


=== Further debugging options

The agent offers even more options for finding out many details about the concrete
behavior of the agent than those already described. With the `help`
option, among other things you get a detailed and complete list of the available
options beyond those described here.


[#mrpe]
== Incorporating classic check plug-ins

=== The basic configration

Under Windows you can continue to use its Nagios-based plug-ins on a host if
there is no counterpart in {CMK}.
The mechanism for this is quite simple -- you use the MRPE feature of {CMK}
which behaves analogously to the NRPE of Nagios.

The inclusion of MRPE plug-ins is enabled by default. If you do not want to use
this feature you can deactivate it in the configuration file by adding the
following definition:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
mrpe:
  enabled: no
----


==== Limiting the execution time

Sometimes the runtime of a script or Nagios plug-in is unpredictable, and in the
worst case, a plug-in never ends.
To maintain control here you can limit the maximum runtime of the MRPE plug-ins.
The value shown here is also the default value in seconds, so alter this value only if you want to set a shorter or longer interval:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
mrpe:
  # enabled: yes
  timeout: 60
----


=== Executing plug-ins via MRPE

To tell the agent where the file to be run can be found, and how to call it,
add an entry in the MRPE configuration:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
mrpe:
  config:
    - check = MyServiceName 'C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\mrpe\my_check_plugin.bat' -w 10 -c 20 MyParameter
----

It is not a requirement that the file be stored in the the agent’s directory,
even if it makes sense to store everything in a common location.
In this configuration example you can see the following elements for the
relevant line:

[cols="40,~"]
|===
|Element |Description 

|`MyServiceName` |The service name as it should be displayed in {CMK}
|`'C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\mrpe\my_check_plugin.bat'` |The script or program to be called. Since file paths and filenames under Windows may contain spaces, the parentheses mark the connection of the expression.
|`-w 10 -c 20` |Options have been passed to this script -- in this case a threshold of 10 for {WARN}, and a threshold of 20 for {CRIT}.
|`MyParameter` |To finalise, the script has been given a parameter that does not belong to a specific option.
|===


After you have set up the MRPE plug-in, it will be immediately become active  without needing a reboot of the agent, and it will be added to the output.
In the service discovery you will now automatically find your new service:

[{image-border}]
image::agent_windows_service_discovery.png[]


=== MRPE with the Agent Bakery

{cee-only}
Alternatively to configuring directly on a host in the user-specific configuration file, you can also define your MRPE plug-ins directly in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu.
To do this, use the [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent > Agent rules > Execute MRPE checks# rule set.
The necessary entry is then generated automatically in the xref:agent_windows#files[Agent Bakery configuration file].


[#plugins]
== Adding agent plug-ins

=== What are plug-ins?

The standard agent contains a whole series of sections which provide monitoring
data for various check plug-ins, which are then found automatically by a service
discovery and output as services.
Above all, this includes the important monitoring of the operating system.

In addition there is the possibility of extending agents with agent plug-ins.
These are small scripts or programs called by the agent to extend the agent with
additional sections of monitoring data. The {CMK} project already provides quite
a few such plug-ins which -- if they are installed and configured
correctly -- via a service discovery also automatically create new services.

Why are these plug-ins not tightly-integrated with the standard agents?
For each of the plug-ins one of the following reasons applies:

* The plug-in can only get its data via internal interfaces which the standard agent does not provide (PowerShell for example).
* The plug-in in any case needs a configuration, without which it would not work (`mk_oracle.ps1` for example).
* The plug-in is so specialised that most users do not need it (`citrix_licenses.vbs` for example).

[#manual_installation_of_plugins]
=== Installing plug-ins manually

As already mentioned, as standard {CMK} provides a whole series of plug-ins for Windows. You can find these on the monitored host in the agent’s installation
directory. There all available plug-ins are always stored directly with the
agent so that they are also directly available for use:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\check_mk\service\plugins`.
Alternatively you can also find the plug-ins on the {CMK} server itself in
`local/share/check_mk/agents/windows/plugins`.
These are also available via [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Related > Windows files# in the [.guihint]#Plugins# box.
Here is an excerpt:

.The files themselves often contain useful detailed information
image::agent_windows_files_plugins.png[alt="List of plug-in files."]

For all of the standard agent plug-ins we provide there are also suitable
matching check plug-ins which can evaluate the collected data and generate
services -- thus you do not have to install any extras on the {CMK} server.

*Important*: Have a look at an agent plug-in before you install it on a
host -- you will often find important information on the correct use of the
plug-in.

The actual installation is then easy. Copy the desired plug-in either from the
{CMK} server or from the installation directory to
`C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins`.
If the plug-in is in this directory it will be called automatically by the agent,
and a new section will be created in the agent’s output. This section usually
has the same name as the plug-in. Complex plug-ins -- for example,
`mk_oracle.ps1` -- even create a whole series of new sections.


=== Configuring plug-ins

Some plug-ins require a configuration file in
`C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config` for them to work correctly.
For others a configuration is
optional -- for example `mssql.vbs`) -- this allows for special features
or customizations. Other plug-ins function without further steps because they
have different sources for their information:

* The documentation of the associated check plug-ins, found at [.guihint]#Setup > Services > Catalog of check plugins#
* Comments in the plug-in itself (often very helpful!)
* A corresponding article in this User manual -- for example, that on monitoring xref:monitoring_oracle#[Oracle]

Even with special (script) languages, it may be necessary to _activate_
them in the agent’s configuration. For example, Python scripts will not run
unless explicitly released. You can simply expand the file extensions in
`check_mk.user.yml` in the `global` section,
as shown in the following excerpt:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
global:
    execute: exe bat vbs cmd ps1 py
----

*Important*: The use of such plug-ins of course presupposes that the files
can also be called up in a regular command line without requiring special file
paths. In the case of Python, it must be installed correctly, and the path to
the interpreter must be available in the environment variables. Instructions on
how to set up Python correctly can be found directly on the website of the
link:https://www.python.org/doc/[Python Software Foundation].


[#customizeexecution]
=== Customizing the execution of a special plug-in

Each plug-in can be executed in different modes. The following options are
available. The setting printed in *bold* is the default value:

[cols="12,15,~"]

|`pattern` |`'@user\*.ps1'` |Sets the ranges of the following options. Here you can also work with wildcards. The options below will then apply to all plug-ins that match the expression. It is determined upfront whether the plug-in should be executed directly from the installation directory or from the data directory.
|`run` |`*yes*/no` |Determines whether the execution of a plug-in should be suppressed.
|`async` |`*yes*/no` |Executes a plug-in asynchronously and stores the data in a file. With synchronous execution, the output is passed directly to the agent.
|`timeout` |`*60*` |Sets the maximum execution time -- if this is exceeded the plug-in is terminated, even if no output has been produced. The default value orients itself to the agent’s default query interval.
|`cache_age` |`*60*` |Specifies in seconds how long an output is valid. If `async` is activated, a cache of ??? seconds is automatically created.
|`retry_count` |`*1*` |The number of times a plug-in can fail before discarding its output from the cache.
|`description` |`‘Text’` |Here you can enter a free text/comment to be added to the logs.

A configuration for the Veeam plug-in looks like this, for example. This extract
is truncated here and contains only the part relevant for this example:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
plugins:
    enabled: yes
    execution:
        - pattern: $CUSTOM_PLUGINS_PATH$\veeam_backup_status.ps1
          async: yes
          timeout: 120
          cache_age: 300
          retry_count: 2
----

The plug-in, as defined above, will be executed asynchronously every five
minutes (300 seconds), and may not exceed two minutes (120 seconds) running time.
If the plug-in reaches this timeout, it will make a second attempt to get a
result.


=== Installing plug-ins using the Agent Bakery

{cee-only}
The plug-ins supplied by {CMK} can be configured via the
xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery].
This ensures both the installation of the plug-in itself, as well as the correct
creation of the configuration file if one should be necessary.

Each plug-in is configured via an agent rule. 
You can find the matching rule sets in [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agents > Agent rules#:

=== Executing plug-ins manually

Since agent plug-ins are executable programs, you can also execute them manually
for testing and diagnostic purposes. There are plug-ins however which need
certain environment variables set by the agent, e.g. to find its configuration
file. If necessary, set these variables by hand if they are needed in a script
or program.


== Security

=== Preliminary considerations

As with the Linux agent, access to the agent for Windows also needs to be secure.
After all, these are potentially sensitive servers that must be protected from
external attacks. For this reason, the same basic principles as under
xref:agent_linux#security[Linux] also apply here.
Likewise with Windows, the agent does not read any data from the network, so an
attacker can never infiltrate commands or scripts via the monitoring port 6556.

If the monitored system is queried over an insecure (internet) connection,
additional measures will be necessary. The agent has an optional built-in
encryption of the transmitted data to protect it from attacks affecting network
traffic. On newer Windows versions the native SSH is additionally optional, so that an encryption over the entire duration of the connection can be guaranteed, as is already familiar under Linux.

These and other methods of protection are described in more detail below.


=== Restricting access by IP address

The restriction to certain IP addresses can certainly be configured via the
xref:agent_windows#firewall[Firewall], additionally however, the agent also has the
ability to simply ignore requests from unfamiliar IP addresses.
Just add the following restriction to the global options in the configuration
file. Note that other parameters can be set before or after this in the
configuration file, and that only the relevant excerpt is shown here:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
global:
  only_from: 127.0.0.1/32 192.168.42.73/32
----

As you can see in the example, in principle you can allow as many subnets as
you like. For example, with a `/32` enter a subnet of `size 1`,
so that only this single address is allowed, while the use of
`192.168.42.0/24` will allow all addresses between `192.168.42.0`
and `192.168.42.255`.

{cee-only}
In the Agent Bakery, you can configure the permitted IP addresses using the following rule set:
[.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules > Allowed agent access via IP address (Linux, Windows)#

Of course an attacker can very easily fake their IP address and thus get a connection to the agent, however it is very unlikely that they will get an answer -- because any answer will be routed to the real monitoring server.
Or if the attacker actually gets an answer the {CMK} server receives no data and will very quickly report an error.


=== Calling via SSH

Newer versions of Windows have native support for SSH, but even with older
versions, using link:https://www.cygwin.com[Cygwin] you can retrofit an
SSH server and replicate an identical configuration to that possible under
xref:agent_linux#ssh[Linux]. For the setup please see the latest Cygwin or Microsoft
support. Once an SSH server has been started and is reachable, further setup is
identical to that under Linux -- you set up the `authorized_keys` on the
monitored host, and restrict access to the execution of the agent.

The entry in the file `authorized_keys` is not very straight-forward on a Windows
host, because you will need to add a few backslashes for masking. Please use the
following example as guidance:

.~\.ssh\authorized_keys:
[{file}]
----
command="\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\checkmk\\service\\check_mk_agent.exe\" test" ssh-rsa AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGb6AaqRPlbEmDnBkeIW3Q6Emb5lr2QEbWEQLmA5pb48 mysite@mycmkserver
----

Note that you can stop the Windows service following this procedure,
and also note that any possible, previously-defined firewall rule is then made
obsolete.
// In principle, operation without an installation is only possible with the binary. But here it goes too far.


=== Built-in encryption

The Windows Agent (and also its Linux
counterpart) encrypts its data without any additional tools.
This is not strictly a substitute for access control -- but since an attacker
cannot send commands and cannot do anything with encrypted output data
anyway -- it comes very close to one.

The effort in using the encryption, and the additional CPU load necessary,
are both less than the method using SSH as described above -- which we however
still recommend using for transmission over the internet.

The encryption of course requires a suitable configuration both on the agent and
on the server. This can either be done by hand ({CRE}),
or with the Agent Bakery ({CEE}).


==== Setting up without the Agent Bakery

Even without the Agent Bakery, the first step is to create a rule in the rule set [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Agent access rules > Encryption (Linux, Windows).# 
The rule should apply to all hosts for which you would like to use encryption.
SNMP hosts ignore this setting, so you do not have to explicitly exclude it.

.On the server itself the password is not encrypted
image::agent_windows_encrypt_agent.png[alt="Dialog with encryption options."]

The [.guihint]#Encryption for agent# setting is important. As long as you leave the rule
on the default [.guihint]#Disable# setting, everything of course remains unaltered.
You can choose between:

* [.guihint]#Enable#: Encryption is enabled, but data from agents without encryption will continue to be accepted.
* [.guihint]#Enforce#: Encryption is turned on, and only encrypted data is accepted.

It makes sense to first start with [.guihint]#Enable#. Once you are confident that all of the agents are using encryption, switch to [.guihint]#Enforce# to find any hosts which still send data in clear text.

The encryption works with a common password (_shared secret_) that you specify here, and which
must be saved in plain text on the {CMK} server as well as in
the agent’s configuration. Choose a random password and keep it ready for the
second step -- configuring the agent.

On the Windows server add the password to the agent’s configuration.
This also goes into the global options:

.C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\check_mk.user.yml
[{file}]
----
global:
  encrypted: yes
  passphrase: MyPassword
----

Now you can perform the following tests
(see also the xref:cmk_commandline#[article on the command line in {CMK}]:

* A `telnet myhost123 6556` from the {CMK} server must produce a jumble of characters.
* A `cmk -d myhost123` on the {CMK} server must display the clean, plain text data.


==== Setting up with the Agent Bakery

{cee-only}
Setting up encryption with the Agent Bakery is very easy.
You can reach the corresponding rule in the {EE} via [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Agent access rules > Encryption (Linux, Windows)#.
With the creation of such a rule you are basically done.
You only need to bake and distribute the new agents.
The necessary entry is then automatically created in the xref:agent_windows#files[configuration file for the Agent Bakery].
The `/etc/check_mk/encryption.cfg` file will be automatically-created and built into the agent packages for you.


== Monitoring Windows with SNMP

There are a few situations in which monitoring via SNMP *in addition* to the normal agent may be useful. And that is in fact the case when either your own application software, or a hardware monitoring tool from the server’s manufacturer can only provide monitoring data via SNMP and -- either due to the Windows version in use, or because there are no cmdlets for the application -- a query through PowerShell is not possible.

In such a case, set [.guihint]#SNMP# to the appropriate connection type ([.guihint]#SNMP v2 or v3# or [.guihint]#SNMP v1#) in the [.guihint]#Monitoring agents# box in the host's properties in the Setup. 
Services which are available via both SNMP and a {CMK} agent (e.g. CPU utilization, file systems, network adapters) will then be fetched automatically from the {CMK} agent and not via SNMP.
This will automatically avoid a duplicated transfer.


[#uninstall]
== Uninstalling the agent

You have several options for uninstalling the agent in Windows.
In all versions of Windows you will find an entry under [.guihint]#Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program#.
In newer versions you can also find the entry for the {CMK} agent in under [.guihint]#Settings > Apps & features#.

From the command line, you have several options for removing the agent.
If you still have the most recently installed MSI package, you can use it for uninstallation as follows:

[{shell}]
----
C:\Users\hhirsch\downloads\> msiexec /x check_mk_agent.msi /qn
----

Alternatively, you can use the Windows Management Instrumentation Command (WMIC) to uninstall:

[{shell}]
----
C:\> wmic product where name="Check MK Agent 2.0" call uninstall /nointeractive
----

If the uninstallation was successful, you will receive the message `Method execution successful.` as confirmation.

*Note:* The string after `name=` must be exactly correct.
If you want to uninstall another version of the agent here, you will find a list of all installed products with the following call:

[{shell}]
----
C:\> wmic product get name
----

The process can sometimes take quite a long time and will not provide any status messages, but will output very long lists.
For filtering you can extend the command to a pipe:

[{shell}]
----
C:\> wmic product get name | findstr Check
----

Pay attention to upper and lower case!

Since the various routines in Windows only remove files that also got there through the installation process, it is perfectly normal that some files could remain in the xref:agent_windows#files[the agent's directories].
These can be deleted manually.
