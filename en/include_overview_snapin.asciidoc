Prominently placed at the top of the sidebar you will find the [.guihint]#Overview# snapin:

image::overview_less.png[alt="Overview snapin in Show less mode.",width=50%]

In the left column of this small table you will first see the number of hosts and services you are monitoring. 
The third row shows [.guihint]#Events#. 
These only become relevant for you if you have configured the monitoring of messages. 
This means, for example, messages from syslog, SNMP traps and log files.
For this, {CMK} has its own very powerful module, which will be discussed in detail in the article of the same name, the xref:ec#[Event Console].

The right column shows the number of problems that have not yet been acknowledged.
Problems are objects that are currently in {WARN}/{CRIT}/{UNKNOWN} or {DOWN}/{UNREACH} status.
_Acknowledgement_ is a way of 'taking note' of a problem.
By the way, problems of services whose host is {DOWN} or in a scheduled downtime are not counted here.

You can click on the number in a cell to get a list of the objects that have been counted here. 
This works for all cells in the [.guihint]#Overview#, by the way.

In the [.guihint]#Overview# you can also decide whether you want to see less or more information.
With the icon:button_showmore[alt="Icon for switching to Show more mode."] button you can switch to the Show more mode:

Between the two previously visible columns, the new second column now shows the count for *all* problems, i.e. with the addition of those that have already been acknowledged. 
In our example, the numbers in the second and third columns are identical because we have not yet acknowledged any problem.

Finally, the last column on the far right shows the hosts or services whose information is 'out of date' -- _Stale_ -- because no up-to-date monitoring data is currently available for them. 
If, for example, a host is not currently accessible, {CMK} cannot retrieve any information from its services. 
However, this does not automatically mean that the services have a problem. 
Therefore, {CMK} does not simply assume a new status for these services, instead it sets them to the pseudo status 'Stale'. 
The column [.guihint]#Stale# will be omitted by {CMK} from the display if it would only show a 0 in all cases.
