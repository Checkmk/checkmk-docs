:title: Extending the monitoring system further
:description: Examples to expand monitoring with {CMK} after setup are: optimising security, monitoring very large environments and using Business Intelligence (BI).

[#security]
== Optimising security

Even if monitoring is 'only' observation, the matter of IT security is still very
important, especially when connecting and setting up remote systems.
In the link:security.html[article on security] you will find an overview of topics with
which you can optimise the security of your system.

[#distributed_monitoring]
== Monitoring very large environments

When your monitoring reaches a scale where you are monitoring thousands or even
more hosts, questions of architecture and optimisation become more urgent.
One of the most important issues is link:distributed_monitoring.html[distributed monitoring].
Here you work with several {CMK} sites that are interconnected to form a large
system and which can be distributed globally as required.

[#availability]
== Availability and SLAs

{CMK} can calculate very precisely how high the link:availability.html[availability] of
hosts or services was within certain time frames, how many outages there were,
how long such outages continued, and much more.

Based on the availability data, the link:sla.html[SLA] software module included in the
{CEE} enables a much more detailed evaluation for aid in complying with service
level agreements -- and such agreements can even be actively monitored.

[#inventory]
== Hardware and software inventory

The link:inventory.html[hardware/software inventory] is actually no longer a part of
monitoring, but {CMK} can use the already existing agents to generate extensive
information on the hardware and software in your monitored systems.
This is very helpful for maintenance, licence management or the automatic
filling of configuration management databases.

[#ec]
== Monitoring messages and events

So far we have only dealt with monitoring the current states of hosts and services.
A completely different matter is the evaluation of spontaneous messages that
appear for instance in log files or which are sent via the syslog or SNMP traps.
{CMK} filters relevant events from the incoming messages, and has a completely
integrated system called the link:ec.html[Event Console] for this purpose.

[#nagvis]
== Visualisation using maps and diagrams

With the integrated link:nagvis.html[NagVis] add-on in {CMK}, you can display states on
customised maps or diagrams. This is excellent for creating appealing general
overviews, such as on a monitor in a control room.

[#bi]
== Business Intelligence (BI)

With the link:bi.html[Business Intelligence] software module integrated in {CMK},
you can derive the overall status of business-critical applications from the
many individual status data and display these clearly.

[#reporting]
== Creating PDF reports

The information available in {CMK} -- views, availability tables, graphs, logos,
and much more -- can be compiled into link:reporting.html[reports] and exported as
printable PDF documents. PDF reports can only be created in the {CEE}.


[#agent_updater]
== Automated updating of the agents

If you monitor many Linux and Windows servers, you can use the
link:agent_deployment.html[Agent Updater] included in the {CEE} to have a centralised method
for keeping your monitoring agents and their configurations up to date.


[#devel]
== Developing your own plug-ins

Even though {CMK} offers nearly 2000 check plug-ins, it can still sometimes be
that a specific plug-in is missing. For an introduction to developing your own
plug-ins, see the link:devel_check_plugins.html[article on writing check plug-ins].
