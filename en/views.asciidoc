== Introduction

The most important task performed by {CMK}’s link:user_interface.html[user interface] is
displaying the current status of hosts and services. This is achieved largely
with [.guihint]#views# in a table format. In order for the daily operations to run as efficiently
as possible, these tabular views provide numerous functions, and they can be
customised to meet your requirements.

=== Global and context views

We distinguish between *global* views and those that require a
*context*. Global views can always be called-up directly. An example of a
global view is the list of all current service problems. A context view -- the
[.guihint]#Status of Host ...# view for example -- namely needs to specify by name the
host whose status is to be displayed. Such views can only be called-up in
situations relevant to a particular host.

The global view is most easily accessed via the monitor menu.

image::monitor_menu_less.png[]

Alternatively, you can use the [.guihint]#Overview# and
[.guihint]#Views# sidebar elements. In the overview each number is clickable and takes you to a
global view that individually lists the hosts or services counted in each case.

image::views_tactical_overview.png[width=42%, align=center]

All global views are accessible in the [.guihint]#Views# element -- grouped according to
theme. In addition you will find a few entries that aren’t actually [.guihint]#Views# --
such as for example, the link:dashboards.html[Dashboards], which are sorted under the
[.guihint]#Overview# theme. Dashboards can however _contain_ views.

image::views_snapin_views.png[width=42%, align=center]

From a global view, with a further step you can access the details for a
particular host or service. The names of hosts and services and
the individual cells in other columns are clickable &hellip;

image::views_all_hosts.png[]

&hellip; and bring you to a more detailed (context-dependent) view.

==== Context-dependent views

In views that relate to a specific host or service, you will find all sorts of entries in the menu [.guihint]#Host# or respectively [.guihint]#Service#, which will then take you to other views with the same context -- i.e. for the same host or service.

image::views_context_buttons.png[]

You can also access host- and service-specific views by searching within the Monitor menu:

image::views_monitor_search.png[width=60%, align=center]

Another way to the detailed view is via the Quicksearch snapin in the sidebar:

image::views_snapin_quicksearch.png[width=42%, align=center]

Which view you receive will depend on the result of the search. If the search
identifies a host explicitly, you will reach this host's
[.guihint]#Services of host ...# page directly. There you will again find the menu items
for the other views of this same host. A click on the host's name takes you to
the [.guihint]#Status of Host# view.

image::views_services_of_host.png[]

==== Effect in the menu bar
[#menucontext]
The distinction between global, host-specific and service-specific
views is also noticeable in the _menu bar_. Always present
are the menu items [.guihint]#Commands, Add to, Export, Display and Help#.

In global _host views_ there is also the item [.guihint]#Hosts# as well as in global service views
[.guihint]#Services# -- note the plural here! You can use this, for example, to call up the xref:availability#[availability] of all hosts or services of the current view.

image::views_menu_global.png[]

Views of a single host, on the other hand, contain the menu items [.guihint]#Host# and [.guihint]#Services# with all actions for the current host and all services for the current view.

image::views_menu_context_host.png[]

Views of a single service likewise contain the entry
[.guihint]#Host#, but additionally, now in the singular, the entry [.guihint]#Service#, with actions for this one service.

image::views_menu_context_service.png[]

== Using views

=== Options, filters and commands

At the top left of every view there are six symbols with which you can influence the display, and
trigger actions:

[#filter]

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|Menu item |Function

|[.guihint]#Commands# |Here you can execute link:commands.html[commands] to the object shown (e.g., entering scheduled downtimes).  The commands are described in detail in their link:commands.html[own article].
|[.guihint]#Display > Filter# |Opens the dialogue with the [.guihint]#filters#. With this you can further restrict the displayed data. As soon as you set a filter the symbol on icon:button_filters_set_lo[] changes so that it is clear that under certain circumstances not all data will be displayed.  Conversely, some views already have predefined filters, (e.g. the list of all problems). Here, by removing the filters you can also have more data displayed.  Changes to filters are not saved, rather they are reset when you quit the view.
|[.guihint]#Display > Show checkboxes# |With this you switch checkboxes on or off. Using the checkboxes you can restrict the commands to selected data sets.
|[.guihint]#Display > Modify display options > Number of columns# |Defines the number of columns for the selected view. Views with multiple columns allow the space available on wider monitors to be fully-utilised. For views that only display a single data set this setting has no effect.
|[.guihint]#Display > Modify display options > Refresh interval# |Defines the view’s refresh interval. You can also disable the automatic refreshing. Be aware that in this case it is possible that you will not be informed of problems that occur in the meantime!
|[.guihint]#Display > Modify display options > Date format# |Change the format for the date display.
|[.guihint]#Display > Modify display options > Time stamp format# |Timestamps can be displayed as absolute, relative, mixed, in combination or as a Unix time stamp.
|===


=== Time and Date

{CMK} shows time stamps as relative values in all of the views of states if these are less than 24 hours in the past or future -- e.g., [.guihint]#16 hours#.
You can switch this in the menu via
[.guihint]#Display > Modify display options# and choose between
displaying only absolute, only relative or both values, or also the
Unix timestamp. You can also specify the date format in this dialog.

image::views_time_date.png[]

=== Sorting

The tabular views can be sorted by clicking on a column's heading. A column has three states that
can be selected through a loop of multiple clicks:

* sorted in ascending order
* sorted in descending order
* column unsorted

Views are initially sorted ‘naturally’ according to how the view is defined. In
service lists the sorting is alphabetic by service name -- with the exception of
_Check_MK_ services which are always at the top. The [.guihint]#Check_MK# service is
responsible for managing the monitoring agent. There are also the 
[.guihint]#Check_MK Discovery# and [.guihint]#Check_MK HW/SW Inventory# services. In order to
sort such a list by the current state of the services a click on [.guihint]#STATE# will
suffice.

image::views_sort_by_state.png[]

Sorting by the [.guihint]#Perf-O-Meter# column sometimes produces surprising results.
This is due to the graphic display of the link:graphing.html[values] being partly a
percentaged summarisation of the actual values. The sorting is however performed
according to absolute values, and is always based on the _first metric_
produced by a service.

[#export]
=== Exporting

Data displayed in a view can be exported a number of formats:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|Menu item |Action

|[.guihint]#Data > Export CSV# |A semicolon is used as a separator. The individual cells are enclosed in quotes. The first line contains the internal abreviations for each column.
|[.guihint]#Data > Export JSON# |For an export in JSON-format, the cells also end up in quotes, separated by breaks and commas, enclosed by square brackets.
|[.guihint]#Reports > This view as PDF# |Only in {EE}: This creates a so-called _Instant-Report_, which converts the current table view into a PDF document, minus icons, navigation and so on. Its layout can be customised with special templates in the link:reporting.html[report module].
|[.guihint]#Reports >  Various# |Depending on the current table view, further PDF exports are offered, e.g. for availability, as well as individually-created report templates, if available.
|[.guihint]#REST API > Query host/service resource# |Output of the xref:rest_api#[REST API] for host/service selection of the current (filtered) table view.
|===


[#limit]
=== The display limit

In a larger monitoring environment displaying all views is no longer practical.
When you are monitoring 50,000 services and select the [.guihint]#All Services# view,
not only will the display require a very long time -- it will also not be very
useful.

In such situations, in order to protect the user from long waiting times and to
avoid crippling the system with absurd quantities of data, views are limited to
1000 entries in their display. Exceeding this limit produces the following
warning:

image::views_limit1.png[width=80%]

As you can see, the records being displayed are not necessarily the first 1000
corresponding to the selected sorting method! There is a technical reason for
this: namely that the limit is applied to the data source in the connected
site’s monitoring cores. This is very important, because if we accumulate
one million data records from your environment spread around the world, then
99.9% of the data will be deleted immediately. The sorting takes place from the
end of the list, thus it happens _after_ the limit. The data from all
instances must, after all, be sorted together.

If you really want to see more than one thousand records, then you can reach the
next level by clicking on [.guihint]#Repeat query and allow more results#. Here the
limit is 5,000 records. If this limit has again been exceeded, with
_unlimited_ you can continue. Insofar this is a potentially risky action,
you will require _Administrator rights_. You have been warned!

image::views_limit2.png[width=80%]

You can define both levels under [.guihint]#Global Settings > User Interface#:

image::views_limit3.png[]


[#edit]
== Customising views

=== The basics

{CMK} allows you to customise its standard views, and even to create new ones that you can
incorporate into link:reporting.html[reports] and link:dashboards.html[dashboards]. Thus you can define numerous
different aspects for every view:

* *General items* such as title, theme, etc.
* Which *data source* is to be displayed (e.g. hosts, services, events on the Event Console, etc.)?
* Which selection of records is to be displayed (*filtering*)?
* Which *columns* will be displayed?
* Which other views are *linked* to the text in the columns?
* What is the standard *sorting* method?
* Is there a *grouping*, and if so, how does it look?
* Where and for which user should the view be *visible*?
* Which style of *table layout* should be used?

The edit mode for views can be accessed in two ways:

. From an active view via the menu item [.guihint]#Display > Customize view# -- with which a clone of the current view is created.
. In the menu [.guihint]#Display > Customize view#. There you can create completely new views with icon:button_add_view[], or customise existing ones with icon:button_clone[]:

image::views_edit_views.png[]


=== Clone first -- then modify

The views supplied as standard are a part of the software and as such cannot be
changed, however {CMK} does recognise the concept of _cloning_. When a view
is first customised (regardless if by using icon:context_button_edit_view[]
or via the list) a copy of that view is created automatically. This copy is
added to your user profile.

This copy can then be customised as desired. The original view is retained but
is _greyed-out_ -- overlaid by your new version in effect. You can return to
the standard view later by simply deleting your clone (achieved in the table of
views, as you might expect, with icon:icon_delete[]).

This concept has one further advantage: namely, that you can define whether the
view should be changed _for all users_ or just for yourself. This is
specified in the view’s [.guihint]#General Properties# with the
[.guihint]#Make this view available for all users# checkbox. Not surprisingly, you can only
select this checkbox if you have link:wato_user.html#roles[administrator permissions]
(or more correctly, this function has its own permission -- [.guihint]#Publish views#).
Additionally, single views can be locked in the
link:wato_user.html#roles[role definitions].

What happens when a view has been customised and published by several users? Each user
then has their own variant of the view. Which view will be visible for which
user(s)? This can be determined with the following rules:

. When a user creates a view for themselves, this will always have priority for them.
. After this are views that have been customised and published by an administrator (to be precise, someone with the [.guihint]#Modify builtin views# permission).
. If there are none here, then those views apply that another normal user with the [.guihint]#Publish Views# permission has published.
. And when there is also nothing here then the supplied default version will be visible.

How can you create a _real copy_ of a view, so that when done you can have
both the supplied and your own views?  This is defined by using [.guihint]#Unique ID# in
the [.guihint]#General Properties#. Simply give your view a new name, so that it will no
longer be identified as a clone of the supplied view, rather it will begin its
own independent life.

This ID is the decisive keyword for opening views in the URL. The schema is very
simple. Here for example is how the global view with its ID `allhosts`
is opened:

`/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=allhosts`

The concepts of cloning, customising and visibility can be found at many other
locations in {CMK}, namely in:

* xref:dashboards#[dashboards]
* xref:reporting#[reporting]
* xref:graphing#graph_collections[graph collections]
* xref:graphing#custom_graphs[custom graphs]
* xref:user_interface#bookmarks[bookmark lists]


=== Integrating a view into the sidebar

How and if a view will be shown in the sidebar’s [.guihint]#Views# element, is defined under [.guihint]#General Properties#
by the following characteristics:

image::views_edit_view_general_properties.png[]

* [.guihint]#Title# -- the item’s name
* [.guihint]#Topic# -- the view will be sorted under this topic. You can also define other topics.
* [.guihint]#HSort index# -- how high up the view appears in the menu
* [.guihint]#Visibility# -- Suppress entry and/or share with other users


=== Basic layout

The next block -- [.guihint]#View Properties# -- defines a view’s general appearance:

image::views_edit_view_view_properties.png[]

The [.guihint]#Number of Columns# option sets the default for the
number of columns shown in the view, the [.guihint]#Automatic page reload# the
default for the refresh counter. Both values can be modified by the user
in the view itself via [.guihint]#Display > Modify display options.#

Under [.guihint]#Basic Layout# there are various styles for displaying the data in
tables. Most views use [.guihint]#table# -- a normal table that can be sorted by columns
-- or [.guihint]#Single data set# -- which has the legend on the left and which is mostly
used for single data sets. You can however also use [.guihint]#single data set# for
views with more than one object.  The [.guihint]#All Hosts# view looks something like
this when altered to [.guihint]#Single data set#:

image::views_layout_single_dataset.png[]

=== Columns and grouping

The [.guihint]#Columns# box defines which columns you wish to see. The _number of columns
possible_ selection depends on the selected data source. The most columns are
found  in services, naturally, as all information for the particular service is
available. The list can be quite long here, and if you are uncertain which
column is the right one, there is only one thing to do -- try it out:

image::views_edit_view_columns.png[]

Depending on the column selected, there may be specific options for this.
With the column [.guihint]#Hosts: Hostname#, for example, it is possible to
color the hostname according to its status using the [.guihint]#Coloring# option.

The [.guihint]#Link# field offers a selection of all views. If a view is selected here,
then the column’s respective cell is _clickable_ and takes the the user to
the chosen view.  This really only makes sense if the targetted view has a
context. The best example is the [.guihint]#All Hosts# view. The [.guihint]#Hostname# column is
clickable here and takes the user to this host’s [.guihint]#Services of host#. Alternatively, dashboards can be specified here -- which obviously do not require a context.

Under [.guihint]#Tooltip#, on the other hand, you will find a list of all columns. Thus
you can show further information for the host or service when the user moves
the mouse cursor over the respective cell (the IP-address in this example).

image::views_hover_address.png[]


=== Information for services in a host view

Let’s imagine that you’d like to display the information for particular services
in a table of hosts. The following example illustrates this situation very well:
here the current uptime, the CPU load, the memory usage and the
NTP-synchronisation are shown for each host:

image::views_joined_columns_example.png[]

Here a table of hosts has been generated in which for each host the
[.guihint]#Perf-O-Meter# *service column* for four different services is displayed.
One sees that for one of the three hosts the [.guihint]#CPU load# and the [.guihint]#Memory#
services do not exist and that the column is consequently empty.

This view’s configuration was achieved by adding columns of the
[.guihint]#Joined column# type. Here the column for services in which [.guihint]#Perf-O-Meter#
has been selected appears under [.guihint]#Column#.  The [.guihint]#Title# entry defines the
column's heading. The service’s *exact* name must be entered (upper and lower
case sensitive!) in the [.guihint]#Of Service# field:

image::views_edit_view_columns_2.png[]

Of course such a display is only useful when the view shows a list of similar
hosts, all of which also utilise the selected services. This is also the reason why
{CMK} does not provide views of this type -- which columns are meaningful here
depends entirely on the type of host selected. For Linux servers the information
of interest is certainly completely different to that for USVs, for example.


=== Sorting in views

The sorting within a view is configured in the the fourth block. It’s only a matter
of the predefined sorting method. Users can -- as described above -- determine
the sorting order themselves with a click on the column heading. In the view’s
configuration however you have more possibilities -- you can define a
_multi-step_ sorting order, e.g. first by service-status, and for the same
status by service name.  The order so determined is retained as a subordinate
sorting when the user resorts in a specific column.

image::views_edit_view_sorting.png[]


=== Grouping

Through grouping you can divide a table into several segments -- in which each
segment’s data is related in some way. The best example of this is the
[.guihint]#Service problems# view, which is easily reached via the
[.guihint]#Overview# snapin.

As you can see, this table is grouped with
_Service status_ (first all {CRIT}, then {UNKNOWN}, then {WARN}) - each
with its own group header:

image::views_edit_view_grouping.png[]

The grouping in a view is configured similarly to that with the columns. Simply define
which column the grouping should relate to. It is usually only one, but can be
more. All records with the same value for all selected columns will then be
displayed in a group -- and the column heading will be shown as the group title.

It is important that you also *sort* the records by priority according to
the group’s selected characteristic! Otherwise it can be possible that the same
group makes multiple appearances (which may at times be desirable).
Incidentally, a resorting by column performed by a user has no effect on the
grouping -- in such a case only the group’s sequence is determined and the
records sorted within the group. The groups themselves are unchanged.


=== Filters, contexts and searches

An important aspect of views is the _data selection_. Which hosts or
services should be displayed in a table? {CMK} uses the *Filter* concept
for this purpose. Here are a couple of examples of host-filters:

image::views_filter.png[]

Every filter can be defined with search terms or other criteria by a user, thus
reducing the list of results to those records meeting the criteria. In this way
the filters are AND-linked. The filter criteria actually used for a view are
assembled from three sources:

. Filters with criteria defined as standard for the view
. Filters set interactively by the user with icon:icon_filter[] in the view
. Filters that can be set with variables via the URL

The filters you assemble by editing in the view’s [.guihint]#context/search filters# box
have two functions. Firstly, by clicking on icon:icon_filter[] you can decide which filter will be available to a user. Secondly, you can predefine
filters using criteria, thus limiting the data to be displayed in the view
(point 1 above).

When you create or edit a view by using *context* -- instead of the filter for
the relevant object only an optional entry field appears. In this an
_exact_ comparison always applies (upper and lower case sensitive). As an
example we can take the `host` view, which displays all services of a
_specified_ host. The host’s name can be specified by adding a context to the
view. You can also build a display in which the host to be displayed is effectively
*hard-coded* directly in the view:

image::views_edit_view_context_filter.png[]

In this way you can call the view without context, or if desired, simply add it
to the sidebar’s [.guihint]#Views# element without problem.

=== Special search views

The [.guihint]#Host search# and [.guihint]#Service search# (and other)
views supplied as standard behave in a special way in relation to the filters. When you you select
one of these views, it opens with a filter formula, and then only shows hosts
and services when this filter is activated.

Why is this so? Because it would simply be very impractical if you first had to go to
[.guihint]#All services#, and then be forced to wait until several thousand services are
displayed before you could filter the result with a search entry. This behaviour
is regulated by the [.guihint]#Show data only on search# option:

image::views_edit_view_view_properties_show_data.png[]


[#new]
== Creating new views

Creating a new view with icon:context_button_new[] functions in principle
just like the editing of an existing view -- with one small difference: you must
first select a *data source* and a *specific object type*.

=== Data sources

image::views_create_view_1.png[]

The data source is what you might call a table or database view under databases.
{CMK} does not use SQL-Data bases, but it is similarly-structured internally. In
most cases you will be correct with [.guihint]#All services# or [.guihint]#All hosts#. There
are however a few data sources that should be listed briefly here:

[cols=2]
|===
|Data source |Meaning

|Host and service groups, various |see below
|[.guihint]#Alert Statistics# |xref:livestatus#_statistiken_abrufen_stats[Status statistics]
|BI, various |xref:bi#[Business Intelligence]
|[.guihint]#Event Console#, host and service events |xref:ec#[Event Console]
|[.guihint]#Inventory#, various |xref:inventory#[inventory items]
|[.guihint]#The Logfile# |xref:livestatus.html#logs[Livestatus data]
|===


==== Host and service groups

The [.guihint]#Hostgroups# and [.guihint]#Servicegroups# data sources -- per line -- provide the
information on the group itself -- accordingly there are no filters for
individual hosts or services. An example of this data source is the standard
[.guihint]#Host groups (Summary)# view. In distributed environments the
[.guihint]#Hostgroups, merged# and [.guihint]#Servicegroups, merged#  data sources work in exactly the same way.

image::views_hostgroups_summary.png[]

However, if you want information about individual hosts, but grouped according to host
groups, you can use [.guihint]#Hosts: Host groups the host is member of#. Since hosts can be assigned to multiple groups, you will then find a single area
in the view for each *host group combination,* which applies to at least one host.

image::views_hostgroups.png[]

You can proceed in the same way with services and service groups.

Depending on the selected data source, various columns are available for
building the view.

=== Object type -- global or with context

image::views_create_view_2.png[]

Here it can be decided whether your new view should have a context or if it will
be a global view. The selections available to you depend on the data source. The
most common context by far is ‘Host’. The image above appears after selecting
the [.guihint]#All services# data source.

Checking the [.guihint]#Show information of a single host# box defines that the new view
describes one specific host. You will thus have created the basis for a view that is
not globally-visible, but instead visible via a link:

* For a host view with a context
* As a link in a column (see above, e.g., click on a host name in a view)

There are two options for the [.guihint]#Service# context type. If you select only
[.guihint]#Show information of a single service#, you can build a view that displays all
services with the same name on _different hosts_. If it should be a
specific service for a single host, then check the
[.guihint]#Show information of a single host# box.


== The matrix

When you specify the [.guihint]#Matrix# layout in one of your views you will probably see strange things at
first, and ask yourself what is going on. The matrix is certainly not intuitive on first viewing,
but you can achieve good things with it.

In the supplied standard views there is one that utilises this layout -- and that is
[.guihint]#Search performance data#. You find this view via
[.guihint]#Customize > Visualization > Views.#

The following image shows the search for the
expression `CPU|^memory|Filesystem /opt/omd/sites/mysite`:

image::views_matrix_filter_service.png[width=50%]

The result is a neat table of my hosts, in which all of the service’s metrics
are listed adjacent to each other. Not all of the hosts have the same services, so some of the fields
are simply empty:

image::views_matrix_view_1.png[]

The result at first looks very similar to that described earlier --
[.guihint]#Information for services in a host view#. There are a couple of significant
differences however:

. The list of services is dynamic and has no fixed configuration.
. Here the hosts are the columns -- not the lines.
. With the matrix you can do much more.

When you look at the view’s definition you can see how it is constructed:

* [.guihint]#Matrix# is specified in [.guihint]#Basic layout#.
* The [.guihint]#Hostname# is specified as the only column in [.guihint]#Grouping#.
* In [.guihint]#Columns# the [.guihint]#Service description# and the [.guihint]#Service Perf-O-Meter# are specified.

The rule for the matrix layout is:

* The *[.guihint]#Grouping columns#* are used as headings for the vertical columns.
* The *first normal [.guihint]#column#* on the left provides the titles for the lines.
* All *further normal [.guihint]#columns#* are shown in the cells.

If, for example, you wish to display more information regarding the host, simply add more
columns in the [.guihint]#Grouping# section. Thus the table from above will look like
this when you insert the [.guihint]#Host icons# and [.guihint]#WATO folder -- just folder name#
columns:

image::views_matrix_view_2.png[]

Further normal columns then land directly in the cells. The following example
shows (abbreviated) the matrix with the additional [.guihint]#Output of check plugin#
column:

image::views_matrix_view_3.png[]

=== Recognising outliers

Why do some cells have a coloured background? This alerts you to values
*lying outside the majority*. This is actually not so meaningful for
measurement data, but there are, for instance, users with a specially-constructed
matrix who can tell at a glance if an incorrect contact group has been entered
for certain hosts or services!

image::views_matrix_view_4.png[]


[#alarm_sounds]
== Alarm sounds

A view can sound an alarm tone over the browser if at least one problem appears
in the table (a host that is not {UP}, or a service that is not {OK}). This
primitive type of alarm is, for example, interesting for control centres where there is
always a list of problems on a screen that the operator doesn’t want to have to
constantly stare at.

The alarm sounds are by default deactivated. You can switch them on with the
[.guihint]#Global settings > User interface > Enable sounds in views# global switch. As
always the search field helps here:

image::global_settings_enable_sound.png[]

Sounds will not be heard in all views, rather only in those for which sounds have been
activated in [.guihint]#View Properties#:

image::view_properties_sounds.png[]


[#embed_views]
== Embedding views in external websites

Since every view is accessible via a URL you can also embed these in other
websites, for example, via an `&lt;iframe&gt;`. A number of elements in
a view could however make no sense or even be distracting in such a context. In a
situation like this you can attach a `display_options=...` variable to the
URL, via which you can precisely control which component of the view
should *not* be generated in HTML code.

*Important:* The {CMK} navigation is also usually rather undesirable when embedding, so before you manually set options in a view, let the page be
displayed without navigation and sidebar via
[.guihint]#Display > This page without navigation.#

Every component is coded with a letter and can accordingly be excluded using these.

The following letters have been defined:

[cols="10,~"]
|===
|Option |Effect

| t |Title bar (with heading, breadcrumbs, countdown symbol for page update), menu bar and actions bar are omitted.
| b |Menu items and action buttons that link to other views are omitted.
| f |Menu item [.guihint]#Display > Filter# and its corresponding icon:view_button_filters[] button are omitted.

For example -- if you want to switch off all control elements and buttons and
only display the actual table, a link on the `allhosts` view will look
like this:

`/myserver/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=allhosts&display_options=til`


== Adding your own icons and actions

In views of hosts and services you will also see a column for icons, and in this
the icon:icon_menu[] [.guihint]#Action menu# icon with which you can select host or
service actions. You can also add your own icons to views. These can be used
simply for visualization, or your own actions can be assigned to them.

For example, hosts with a graphic web interface can be quickly identified using
such an individual icon and can also be controlled directly via a link.

The procedure for adding your own icons and actions is divided into three steps:

* Upload the icons
* Define the icons/actions
* Assign the icons to hosts/services

Start with [.guihint]#Setup > General > Custom Icons# and upload a local file with a maximum size of
80x80 pixels. The icon will now be in the system, but will not yet be in use.

Next you will need to define the icon as an object that can be addressed via
link:wato_rules.html[rules], and optionally, an associated action. You can find the
settings for this under [.guihint]#Steup > General > Global settings > User Interface > Custom icons and actions#.
Create a new entry here using [.guihint]#Add new element#, and define [.guihint]#ID#, [.guihint]#Icon#
and a [.guihint]#title#. The title will later be displayed as a tool tip directly on the
icon via a mouse-over-effect, and is therefore indispensable for users.

Now it gets interesting with the [.guihint]#Action# option. Action is equivalent to a
URL, and for this you can make use of some variables such as `$HOSTNAME$` or
`$SERVICEDESC$` (service-description) -- you can get further information
from the online help. A valid action would be, for example:

`view.py?host=$HOSTNAME$&site=mysite&view_name=host`

This action simply calls the standard host view for the corresponding
host on the site _mysite._

With a check mark at [.guihint]#Show in column# you can then display the icon as an
independent icon next to icon:icon_menu[], otherwise your action will end up
in this action menu.


In the final step, you now determine which hosts or services the new icon is to
be displayed for -- specifying these using rules of course. You can find the two
rules, [.guihint]#Custom icons or actions for hosts in status GUI# and
[.guihint]#Custom icons or actions for services in status GUI# in the
[.guihint]#Setup# menu under [.guihint]#Host monitoring rules# and [.guihint]#Service monitoring rules#.

Create a new rule in the desired folder and set at least two options in it. First
select the icon just created under [.guihint]#Custom icons or actions for hosts in status GUI#:

image::views_custom_icons_or_actions.png[]

Then set the filter in the [.guihint]#Conditions# area for the desired
hosts/services.

Finally, save and confirm the changes.

In host and service views you will now be able to see your new icon next to or
in the action menu for the filtered hosts and services.
