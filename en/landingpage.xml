<div class="paragraph"><p><b>Dear reader</b><br />
We are pleased that you have found your way to Checkmk.
</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
As a monitoring software, Checkmk offers comprehensive and specialized solutions 
for dealing with the very diverse environments of IT infrastructures.
This inevitably requires a very comprehensive documentation 
which goes beyond the mere description of the obvious.
Our User Guide will help you as much as possible to
better understand Checkmk, use Checkmk to implement your requirements, as well as helping you to discover new ways of solving problems.
</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
To make the handling of Checkmk as easy as possible, 
the articles in this User Guide follow rather unusual approaches in many places.
It is almost never a matter of simply copying a prefabricated sequence of individual steps.
Rather, it is intended to give you, the reader, a deeper understanding of a feature in Checkmk.
</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
To briefly summarize, our most important premise is 
that the User Guide should be helpful.
And it is most helpful when you can implement our description as a solution for your own problem.
