Checkmk as monitoring software offers comprehensive and specialized options

<p>
To make the work with Checkmk as easy as possible,

</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>

<h3>New to Checkmk?</h3>
<p>
The problem-free operation of IT systems has always been a challenge. Both the complexity of hardware and software and the demands of users continue to increase — whether they are working with real hardware or with cloud solutions. This is why detailed and comprehensive IT monitoring plays such a central role nowadays.
</p>
<p>The requirements that users place on their monitoring are of course as complex as the IT world itself. Checkmk was developed from the outset for large and heterogeneous IT landscapes, which is why it offers such a wealth of functions and options to meet all the problems that result from this in practice. For this reason, the comprehensiveness of Checkmk can be overwhelming for a beginner at first.
</p>
<p>
To make sure you can nevertheless start your first Checkmk monitoring quickly and more easily, we have compiled a Beginner’s guide.
This gives you a compact step-by-step introduction to Checkmk, and it is structured in such a way that you can read it quickly from beginning to end and participate right away.
