== Introduction

link:http://nagstamon.ifw-dresden.de/[Nagstamon] is a small desktop tool
that was originally developed for Nagios. In today's version, the client also
supports {CMK}. It translates a {CMK} view in a very compact form and summarizes
the problems.


Even though there is no official support for Nagstamon, we still want to make
the connection as easy as possible.
Below we describe how to connect Nagstamon with {CMK}.


== Configuration

The simplest method is to connect Nagstamon directly to the {CMK} web UI.
To ensure that this integration works seamlessly, {CMK} delivers two special views,
which Nagstamon then uses as a data source:

* `nagstamon_hosts`
* `nagstamon_svc`

Thus you do not have to initially set up any views to enable the integration.
When you start Nagstamon for the first time, you will be directly asked for a
server -- otherwise you can also set up a new server in the menu via
the [.guihint]#Settings# menu item, where you can create a new connection
via [.guihint]#New server ...#.

In the dialog that appears, select the entry [.guihint]#{CMK} Multisite# under
[.guihint]#Monitor type#, assign a human-readable name and enter the URL of the
connection in the [.guihint]#Monitor URL# field.
*Important:* You can only authenticate here with a regular
user -- an automation user does not work in this case!
A configuration can then look like this, for example:

image::nagstamon-server.png[width=400]

// Über die Option [.guihint]#Show more options# können Sie dann noch Feinheiten
// einstellen und dort zum Beispiel auf die aufgerufenen Views verändern,
// wenn Sie hier eigene konfiguriert haben.

You can then use the [.guihint]#Show more options# option for fine-tuning and if you
have configured your own here views in {CMK}, change to them.


== Diagnostic options

If, contrary to expectations, problems nevertheless arise, first check whether
you can go open the following pages from the device on which Nagstamon is
running. Replace the placeholders with their real values:

* `https://mon.mydomain.org/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=nagstamon_hosts`
* `https://mon.mydomain.org/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=nagstamon_svc`

If this does not work -- using the login data that you have
specified in the configuration -- you will receive a meaningful error message
about what went wrong.
As soon as the call works correctly, Nagstamon should also supply data.
