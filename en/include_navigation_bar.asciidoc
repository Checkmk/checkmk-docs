With the _navigation bar_ on the left and the icons it contains, you make the basic decisions about what {CMK} should do for you:

[.guihint]#Monitor# -- The monitoring itself

[.guihint]#Customize# -- For the customisation of interface elements useful for the monitoring (such as bookmarks, views, dashboards and graphs)

[.guihint]#Setup# -- For the setting up of the objects to be monitored (such as hosts and services)

Behind these three symbols are more or less extensive menus, the so-called 'mega menus' or icon menus, whose entries are divided into several topics -- for example, in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu under the [.guihint]#Hosts# topic you will find entries for configuring hosts, host groups, host tags and host-specific rules.
// We will use one of these entries in the xref:intro_setup_monitor#[next chapter] when setting up the first host.

At the bottom of the navigation bar, in the [.guihint]#User# menu, you will find entries that apply to your {CMK} user account.
At the top right of the menu you will see the current user name (currently `cmkadmin`) and the xref:wato_user#roles[role] (`admin`) assigned to this user. 
In this menu you can change the password, log out of the {CMK} interface and personalise your profile. 
An overview of the available personal settings can be found in the xref:user_interface#user_menu[chapter on the User menu].

In the [.guihint]#Help# menu you will find the edition and version of {CMK} currently in use and some entries with which you can call up documentation and information -- inside {CMK} or outside. 
Among other things, you can also open this User guide. 
If there are incompatible changes after an xref:update#[Update], you will see the number in the [.guihint]#Help# menu icon. 
In the [.guihint]#Help# menu itself, a link in red background colour is then displayed with which you can open the list of _Werks_ of these incompatible changes. 
There are [.guihint]#Help# menu items for calling up version-specific information, including opening the release notes.

The navigation bar is completed at the very bottom by [.guihint]#Sidebar# (which allows you to hide or show the sidebar by simply clicking on it) and at the very top by the {CMK} logo. 
Clicking on the logo always takes you back to the default dashboard displayed on the main page.
