Using the search field in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, you can search the configuration environment of {CMK}, i.e. the [.guihint]#Setup# menu itself, with all of its visible entries and additionally with some hidden ones.

The _search scope_ includes, among other things, all rule sets that are grouped into topics in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu and the _Global settings_.
Searches are carried out in the titles and the parameter names.

You search with free text, i.e. without filter rules as in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu.
You do not need to pay attention to upper and lower case. 
The search results are displayed as you type:
