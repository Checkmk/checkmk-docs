== Introduction

In a regular distributed monitoring with a
xref:distributed_monitoring#distr_wato[centralized Setup], as a rule a user will
log in to the _central site_ in order to work with configurations
or to access the monitoring data.
Users can additionally log in to the _remote sites_ since only they are
responsible for the hosts and services monitored beyond that position.
The authorization concept in {CMK} which uses xref:wato_user#roles[Roles] and
xref:wato_user#contact_groups[Contact groups] to control the visibility and
configurability of hosts and services is quite satisfactory for both of these scenarios.
As a general rule users with very restricted authority will receive no direct
access to the monitoring server's command line and thus will only see the data
for which they themselves are responsible. If in this process, the possibility that
they may become aware of the existence of other hosts and services is not a problem.

With a centralized setup, in the {FE} and {SE} {CMK} will therefore distribute all configuration
files to all participating sites since in principle they could be located or
be required anywhere, as the case may be. Centrally-managed passwords must also
be made available for the _remote sites_ as the hosts and services in
contact groups can be distributed over multiple sites.

When {CMK} is to be provided as a service to a third party however,
specific configuration files are only permitted to be distributed to
specified _remote sites. This means that sensitive customer data may
not be stored on another customers server – a simple restriction of its visibility
in the web interface is therefore insufficient. In any event it is possible that
the local monitoring server is run by the customer themselves,
or that the customer otherwise has a direct access to the server's command line.

In addition it is no longer required that a customer makes configuration changes
centrally – the point of providing such a service is to save the customer
from needing to perform such work. The customer also does not need a centralized
overview since they only need access to their own data.

With the {CME}, via the xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring] in their
central site, for each customer a provider links only the one or more local
sites which belong to that customer. Individual elements in [.guihint]#Setup# will then
be assigned to these sites. When distributing configuration data {CMK} will
now only send data of a general nature or data that has been approved for the site
to a customer's site. The service provider can still easily carry out a configuration
over the central Setup in their own site.
Likewise a central web interface for all of the provider's customers is available
in which they can work with monitoring data. This works in exactly the same way
as in a normal distributed environment with the only difference, that you must use the {CME} on all involved sites:

image::managed_distributed_monitoring_en.png[]

The following elements in {CMK} can be assigned to a customer:

* Remote sites
* Users
* LDAP connections
* Rules and rule packets in the [.guihint]#Event Console#
* Centrally-managed passwords
* Contact groups
* Host and service groups
* Global settings for remote sites

Thus only the customer's own configuration, host and service data is available
to the customer over the site assigned to that customer.
They need only to log in to their own site to receive their own data.
A log in to the service provider's central server is no longer required –
and also no longer possible!

*Important*: The [.guihint]#Managed Services# option in
link:https://checkmk.com/subscription.php?[Licensing] must be selected if the
{CMK} is not for your own use, but rather is intended for monitoring another
business's infrastructure.
This also applies even if the extended functionality of the {CME} is not being used.


== Configurations


=== Installing customers

Installing one of your customers is performed simply in only a single step:
in [.guihint]#Setup > Users > Customers# select the [.guihint]#Add Customer# button, and assign an
explicit ID, as well as the name to be used when displaying it in {CMK}.
Once saved your first customer has been installed in {CMK}.

image::managed_create.png[]

As can be seen the service provider will likewise be treated like a customer
and for this reason has already been defined as a [.guihint]#Provider#.
You may not delete this assignment.


=== Assigning sites

After a customer has been created, next link the appropriate {CMK} components
to this customer. The central site to which all of the customer's other
sites send their data is also known as the _provider site_.
Currently separation of the data only functions if each customer has their own
site assigned to them and this is in turn xref:distributed_monitoring#[connected]
to your provider site. The setup in this case differs at a single point:
in the [.guihint]#Basic settings#, in addition to the ID and the alias,
the previously-defined customer is entered.

image::managed_sites.png[]

Thereby, since the provider is also handled like a customer, via the assignments to
a site {CMK} always knows which host belongs to which customer.

*Note*: The customer site's [.guihint]#Global Settings# can as usual be configured
over the xref:distributed_monitoring#sitespecific[site specific global settings].


=== Further assignments

Alongside the site itself – as mentioned in the introduction – you can also
assign other elements from the [.guihint]#Setup# to a customer. In doing so an element
will be assigned directly to the customer. Alternatively, you can also make it
available to all customers globally.
Here is an example for a user:

image::managed_users.png[]

The assignment is always carried out via the properties of the respective
elements using the [.guihint]#Customer# option.
Exceptions to this are the site-specific global settings.


==== Special features of the Event Console

In the Event Console you can assign individual rules as well as complete
rule packets to a customer.
In the process be aware that with rule packets the inheritance must always be performed.
They thus cannot be – in contrast to host directories – overwritten by the individual rules.
In this way you can always be confident that every rule will be reliably assigned.

If a rule packet has not been assigned to any customer,
the individual rules can be assigned to a customer as applicable.


=== Non-customizable components

All components that have not been discussed in the preceding can not be assigned
to individual customers. Nevertheless, with a few words we will draw attention to
some special features of various components.


==== Business Intelligence

BI-Aggregations cannot be assigned to a specific customer. Therefore all aggregations
and their rules will be assigned to all sites. For this reason the naming of
rules, packets and aggregations should be as generalized as possible,
and accordingly should not contain customer-specific descriptions.

In a future version of {CMK} it may become possible to also assign BI-Aggregations
to an individual customer. Should this become the situation then the
documentation will be updated appropriately.


==== Host tags

Likewise [.guihint]#Host Tags# may not contain confidential
information since the tags are distributed to all sites.


==== Notifications

Rules for notifications often contain contact groups and very specific conditions under
which the notifications should be triggered and sent.
Since these rules are also distributed to all sites, you should especially
avoid using explicit host and service names, contact addresses and other sensitive data.


==== Customization of global users

Note that all customizations of global users will be passed on to all of the
customer's sites. Global users are therefore unsuitable for specialized views,
custom graphs or bookmarks since these can contain sensitive, customer-specific data.
Utilize the global users for exceptional cases rather than for regular everyday tasks.


== Extended views


=== Dashboard

New on the Dashboard [.guihint]#Main Overview# is the [.guihint]#Customers# element in which links
to service problems are located:

image::managed_dashboard.png[width=600]

On selecting a customer a view listing all of the customer's hosts is opened.
This view functions like the [.guihint]#All hosts# view, with the difference here being
that only the specific customer's elements are shown.


=== Snapin

The new [.guihint]#Customers# Snapin functions in exactly the same way as the similar looking
[.guihint]#Site Status# Snapin. Here the status of an individual customer's sites can be
output, and with a click on a status particular customers can be hidden or shown in
the display.

image::managed_snapin.png[width=370]

In contrast to the [.guihint]#Site Status# Snapin, with this Snapin a single click hides
*all* of a customer's sites.


=== Filtering and building views

Of course you can also use the new filters and data sets for your own views in the same way as they are used in the Snapin and the Dashboard.
On the one hand the [.guihint]#Site# filter has been extended to xref:views#using_views[modify what is being displayed]:

image::managed_filter.png[width=60%]

And on the other hand you can build completely xref:views#new[new views] based on
one or all customers. For this purpose select [.guihint]#All customers# as the data source:

image::managed_customer_view.png[]


== Tips for upgrades


=== Introduction

When upgrading an existing environment from the {FE} or {SE} to the {ME} there are a
number of particulars to be aware of. If you only want to switch a single site
the transition is very easy: simply perform a xref:update#detailed[update] of the
site in the usual way, after which all of the important tasks will have been completed.
All hosts, users and other settings that have been performed previously will be
assigned to the [.guihint]#Provider# customer, so that your monitoring will for the time
being function as before. Then in your own good time you can construct a
Managed-Services-Environment.

If the upgrade is to an existing environment in which already deleted sites
have been defined for a customer, there are a couple of more details to consider:


=== Sequence for updates of individual sites

Following the update all of the functions are available for defining customers
and for assigning sites, users, etc. to them.
As already mentioned these will in fact be assigned to the [.guihint]#Provider#.
In an existing xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring] this however also
means that all other sites with this data can not yet use it.
Therefore there is the following sequence for a safe update:

* *First* update all remote sites.
* Update the central site *last*.
* To be safe make *no* changes while the update procedure is processing.

To securely prevent any changes from occurring, these can be disabled
for the duration of the update process. This lock is activated in the
[.guihint]#Setup > General > Read only mode#:

image::managed_read_only.png[]

By the way, with an update in a distributed monitoring all of the compatible
components in {CMK} will be assigned to the Provider.


=== Assignment of customers

Following the update the sites can be assigned to the customers.
Be aware of possible dependencies that could result from the existing
configuration, and assign the correct elements from {CMK}'s other
components to the customers as appropriate before activating the
assignments to a site.

*Important*: At least one user must be transferred to a customer's site.
It makes no difference whether it is a global user to be replicated on all
sites or if it is a customer-specific user.
