== Function

link:https://www.webex.com/team-collaboration.html[Webex Teams^] is an application from Cisco for continuous team collaboration with video meetings, group messaging and file sharing.
Topics or teams are organized in so-called _spaces_.
You can also use such a space to receive notifications from {CMK}.
For the actual connection a webhook must be created in Webex Teams.


== Configuring Cisco Webex Teams

The prerequisite for receiving notifications from {CMK} in Webex Teams is therefore that at least one area (space) is set up.
This can be done in a few seconds and is described in the Webex help:
link:https://help.webex.com/en-US/article/hk71r4/Webex-App-%7C-Create-a-space[Webex App - Create a space^].

For a first test, at any rate it is certainly a good idea to set up a dedicated area with an appropriate name just for {CMK}.

In Webex Teams the _Incoming Webhooks_ app must now be activated or
connected. You can find this app in the
link:https://apphub.webex.com/applications/incoming-webhooks-cisco-systems-38054-23307-75252[Webex App Hub^].

Click on [.guihint]#Connect# on this page.
(If you are not logged into Webex Teams with the browser you are using, the Cisco Webex login dialog will appear first.)

After a short waiting period, at first it looks as if not much has changed -- but now, at the end of the input and selection fields, 
you can specify both a name for the webhook and the area to be used in Webex Teams.
Finally click on [.guihint]#Add#.

Next, copy the webhook URL created in this way by clicking on the corresponding icon:

== Configuration in {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article about xref:notifications#[notifications].

As a reminder:

include::include_ticketsystem.asciidoc[]

The activation in {CMK} is now limited to the specification of the webhook URL copied above:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# select [.guihint]#Cisco Webex Teams#.
. Enter the copied webhook URL.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI within the notification.
Instead of specifying the webhook URL directly here, you can also use {CMK}'s password store and read the URL from one of its entries.

For testing you can use the [.guihint]#Fake check results# and [.guihint]#Custom notification# xref:commands#[commands].
