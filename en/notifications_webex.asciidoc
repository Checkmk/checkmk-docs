link:https://www.webex.com/team-collaboration.html[Webex Teams^] is an application from Cisco for continuous team collaboration with video meetings, group messaging and file sharing.
Topics or teams are organized in so-called _spaces_.
You can also use such a space to receive notifications from {CMK}.
For the actual connection a webhook must be created in Webex Teams.


[#config_webex]
== Configuring Cisco Webex Teams

The prerequisite for receiving notifications from {CMK} in Webex Teams is therefore that at least one area (space) is set up.
This can be done in a few seconds and is described in the Webex help:
link:https://help.webex.com/en-US/article/hk71r4/Webex-App-%7C-Create-a-space[Webex App - Create a space^]

For a first test, at any rate it is certainly a good idea to set up a dedicated area with an appropriate name just for {CMK}.

In Webex Teams the _Incoming Webhooks_ app must now be activated or
connected. You can find this app in the
link:https://apphub.webex.com/applications/incoming-webhooks-cisco-systems-38054-23307-75252[Webex App Hub^].

Click on [.guihint]#Connect# on this page.
(If you are not logged into Webex Teams with the browser you are using, the Cisco Webex login dialog will appear first.)

After a short waiting period, at first it looks as if not much has changed --
but now, at the end of the input and selection fields, you can specify both a name for the webhook and the area to be used in Webex Teams.
Finally click on [.guihint]#Add#.

Next, copy the webhook URL created in this way by clicking on the corresponding icon:

[#config_checkmk]
== Configuring {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

In {CMK} it is now sufficient to specify the webhook URL copied above:

. Create a new notification rule with [.guihint]#Setup > Events > Notifications > Add rule#.
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Cisco Webex Teams#.
. Enter the copied webhook URL:

+
Instead of entering the URL directly here, you can also read it from the xref:password_store#[password store] - provided it was previously stored there.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI within the notification.

When using the following [.guihint]#Contact selection# box, note the following two points:

You can find out how to test the new notification method in the article on xref:notifications#notification_testing[notifications].
