[#start_page]
== Start page

In the {CMK} user interface (_Graphical User Interface_, GUI) you will
see some elements that we do not need at this stage. Many of these are empty, or
show zeros, which is because we have not yet included any objects in the monitoring:

image::empty_dashboard.png[alt="{CMK} startpage page with 'Main dashboard' still empty."]

Nevertheless, you should familiarise yourself with the basic elements of the
interface. Most important is the division into the *navigation bar* on the
left, the *main page* in the middle, and the *side bar* on the right.

*Note:* The [.guihint]#Main dashboard# shown above is that of the {RE}. The {EE} offer by default a different Main xref:intro_tools#dashboards[dashboard] that shows the state of the site.


[#navigation_bar]
== Navigation bar

include::include_navigation_bar.asciidoc[]


[#main_page]
== Main page

What you see on the main page depends on where you are in {CMK}.
After logging in, you will first see the standard or main xref:intro_tools#dashboards[dashboard], which shows an
overview of the current status and recent events on the monitored objects:

image::mainpage_default.png[alt="{CMK} main page with 'Main dashboard'."]

The content of the main page changes depending on your selection in the navigation
bar and also in the sidebar. For example, if you select to change your profile in
the [.guihint]#User# menu, all profile settings will be displayed on the main page.

Below the current page's title you can see the path to that page, always
starting with the name of the menu from the navigation bar. With the help of this
'breadcrumb navigation' you will always know where you are in {CMK}, even after
complex actions, i.e. currently on the [.guihint]#Main dashboard# page in Monitoring.


[#sidebar]
== Sidebar

include::include_sidebar.asciidoc[]

By the way, you can get more detailed information on the above mentioned snapins in the xref:intro_tools#[chapter on monitoring tools].


[#show_less_more]
== Show less or Show more

{CMK} provides a wide range of setting and selection options in many places on
the interface. This selection can sometimes be quite overwhelming, so that one
can lose sight of the essentials and orientation becomes difficult -- not only,
but especially for newcomers to monitoring.

As a measure to reduce complexity, you will find three dots (*...*) in many
locations on the {CMK} interface, such as in the [.guihint]#Overview# or here on the far
right in the first line of the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu:

image::monitor_menu_showmore.png[alt="First line of the Monitor menu with search input field and Show more symbol."]

Whenever you see these ellipsis points, {CMK} offers two views: In the 'Show less'
mode only the most important entries are shown (meant for the beginner),
and in the 'Show more' mode all entries (for the expert). You can switch between
the two views by clicking on the omission points: show more with
icon:button_showmore[alt="Icon for switching to Show more mode."] and show less with icon:button_showless[alt="Icon for switching to Show less mode."].

You set the general behaviour in the settings for your user profile
([.guihint]#Users > Edit profile > Show more / Show less#) by setting one of the two modes
as the default -- or do without both modes and face the unfiltered complexity.


[#search]
== Searching and finding

In the {CMK} interface you will find two central locations for the search -- in
the monitoring environment in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, and in the configuration
environment in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu. The input fields for the search terms can be
found in the first line of the corresponding menu.


[#search_monitor]
=== Searching in the monitoring environment

include::include_searching_in_the_monitoring_environment.asciidoc[]

Apart from the two filters `h:` and `s:` mentioned above, there are others you can use. 
You can find out what these are and how you can also use regular expressions in the xref:user_interface#search_monitor[article on the user interface].


[#search_setup]
=== Searching in the configuration environment

include::include_searching_in_the_configuration_environment.asciidoc[]

The search for rule sets becomes interesting when it comes to xref:intro_finetune#rules[fine-tuning the monitoring] later on, but we are not there yet, because:
