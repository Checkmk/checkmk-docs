The _sidebar_ is your {CMK} cockpit. 
It is the place where you have a continuous overview of the most important monitoring information, 
as well as quick access to the functions that you need most frequently in {CMK}.

In the top row of the sidebar you will see a selection of 5 icons with important actions that many {CMK} users find particularly useful. 
Feel free to click through these icons in turn -- even if, due to the lack of monitored objects at this point, the information displayed is not yet more meaningful than on the [.guihint]#Main dashboard#, to which you can return by clicking on the first icon [.guihint]#Main#.
Below the 5 symbols begins the panel that you can arrange according to your own preferences.

You can compose the complete sidebar according to your preferences.
The sidebar elements, also called 'snapins', serve this purpose.
Snapins are compact GUI containers with predefined functions. 
Since the sidebar is intended to hold *your* preferences, by default a new installation contains only a few snapins:

* [.guihint]#Overview# -- An overview of all monitored objects with their current status information

* [.guihint]#Bookmarks# -- Your personal bookmarks within {CMK}

* [.guihint]#Master control# -- Various main switches for the monitoring

If you click on icon:button_sidebar_add_snapin[alt="Icon for displaying all snapins."] at the very bottom of the sidebar, 
the main page will show you all of the snapins that are currently *not* in your sidebar and that you can add with a single click.
In this preview, the lower area of each snapin shows a short description about its meaning and purpose.
Try it out and fill the sidebar as a test.

Depending on the size of your screen, not all snapins may now be visible.
The fastest way to move vertically through the sidebar is to use the mouse wheel while the mouse pointer is over the sidebar. 
On touchpads, this function is often possible with the gesture 'slide two fingers up and down together' method.

In the sidebar you can manipulate the snapins like this:

* Expand or collapse: 
Click *in* the displayed title of the snapin. 
Alternatively, point to the title bar and then click icon:button_show_snapin[alt="Icon for showing the snapin."] or icon:button_hide_snapin[alt="Icon for hiding the snapin."].

* Show more or less: 
Some snapins (like [.guihint]#Overview#) offer you two views -- either with only the most important information or with all information. 
Point the mouse at the title bar and click icon:button_showmore[alt="Icon for switching to Show more mode."] or icon:button_showless[alt="Icon for switching to Show less mode."] to switch between the two modes.

* Move: 
Press the left mouse button *right next* to the title, drag the snapin up or down to another position in the sidebar and release the mouse button.

* Remove from sidebar: 
Point the mouse at the title bar and click icon:button_sidebar_close_snapin[alt="Icon for removing the snapin from the sidebar."].

So much for the options for customising the sidebar's content. 
As a whole, you can hide and show the sidebar -- with [.guihint]#Sidebar# in the navigation bar -- and you can move its position from right to left so that it docks with the navigation bar -- in the menu [.guihint]#User > Sidebar position#.
