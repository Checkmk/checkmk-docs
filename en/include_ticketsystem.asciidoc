You can not only specify individual users and contact groups as recipients of the notifications.
Instead, you can also define a ticket system or an event engine as the target of the notifications, for example.
However, you must then take two factors into account when creating the notification rules:

. Only a single user may be entered as a contact, i.e. neither a contact group nor an object contact, otherwise several notifications will be sent to the target system for each event.

. If the first point is fulfilled, but this user is used in several notification rules that are of the same type (e.g. ServiceNow), then only the last rule applies in each case.
It is therefore advisable to create a separate functional user for each of these notification rules.
