. When selecting contacts, make sure that the notifications are only sent to _one_ contact, e.g. by selecting a single user.
With the notification methods for ticket systems etc., the contact selection only serves to specify _that_ notifications are sent.
However, the notifications are not sent to the selected user, but to the ticket system.
Note that a contact selection via contact groups, all contacts of an object or similar usually generates several identical notifications for an event, which then end up in the ticket system twice, three times or even more often.

. If the first point is fulfilled, but the user is used in several notification rules for the same method, then only the last rule applies in each case.
It is therefore advisable to create a separate functional user for each of these notification rules.
