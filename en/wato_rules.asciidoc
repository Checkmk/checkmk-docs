== Introduction

In {CMK} you configure parameters for hosts and services by using _rules_.
This feature makes {CMK} very effective in complex environments,
and also brings a number of advantages to smaller installations.
In order to clarify the principle of rule-based configuration we will compare it to the classic method:

=== The classic approach

As an example, let’s take the configuration of the thresholds for {WARN} and {CRIT} in the
monitoring of file systems. With a data base oriented configuration, one would enter a
line for every file system into a table:

[cols=4]
|===
|Host |Filesystem |Warning |Critical 

|mysrv123 |/var |{nbsp}90% |{nbsp}95%
|mysrv123 |/sapdata |{nbsp}90% |{nbsp}95%
|mysrv123 |/var/log |{nbsp}90% |{nbsp}95%
|mysrv124 |/var |{nbsp}85% |{nbsp}90%
|mysrv124 |/opt |{nbsp}85% |{nbsp}90%
|mysrv124 |/sapdata |{nbsp}85% |{nbsp}95%
|mysrv124 |/var/trans |100% |100%
|===



This is relatively clear -- but only because the table in this example is short.
In practice there tend to be hundreds or thousands of file systems.
Tools like copy & paste, and bulk operations can simplify the work, but the basic problem remains --
how can you identify and implement a _concept_? What is the general rule?
How should thresholds for future hosts be preset?

=== Rules-based is better!

A rules-based configuration however *consists* of the concept!
We will replace the logic of the above table with a set of four rules.
If we assume that `mysrv123` is a test system, and that in each case the _first relevant
rule_ applies to every file system, the result will be the same thresholds as in the table above:

. File systems with the mount point `/var/trans` have a 100/100% threshold.
. The `/sapdata` file system on `mysrv124` has a 85/95% threshold.
. File systems on test systems have a 90/95% threshold.
. All (unspecified) file systems have a 85/90% threshold.

Granted, for only two hosts that doesn’t achieve much, but with only a few more hosts it can
quickly make quite a big difference. The advantages of the rules-based configuration are obvious:

* The concept is clearly recognisable and can be reliably implemented.
* You can change the concept at any time without needing to handle thousands of data sets.
* _Exceptions_ are always still possible, but are documented in the form of rules.
* The incorporation of new hosts is simple and less fault-prone.

In summary, then: less work -- more quality! For this reason, with {CMK} you will find an abundance of rules
for customising hosts and services -- such as thresholds, monitoring settings, responsibilities,
alerting, agent configuration and many more.

=== Types of rule sets

WATO organises rules in _Rule sets_. Every rule set has the task of defining
a specific parameter for hosts or services.
{CMK} contains more than 700 rule sets! Here are some examples:

* [.guihint]#Host check command# -- defines how to determine whether hosts are {UP}.
* [.guihint]#Alternative display name for services# -- defines alternative names for services’ displays.
* [.guihint]#JVM memory levels# -- sets thresholds and other parameters for the monitoring of Javas-VMs’ memory usage.

Every rule set is responsible either for hosts or for services -- never for both.
If a parameter can be defined for hosts as well as services, there is a pair of applicable
rules -- e.g., [.guihint]#Normal check interval for host checks# and [.guihint]#Normal check interval for services checks#.

A few rule sets, strictly-speaking, don’t define parameters, rather they create services.
An example are the rules in the _Active checks_ category.
With these you can, e.g., set up an HTTP check for specific hosts.
These rules are classified as host rules -- due to the fact that if such a check exists on a host
it is deemed to be a host characteristic of the host.

Further, there are rule sets that control the link:wato_services.html[Service discovery].
With these you can, for example, define via [.guihint]#Windows service discovery# for which Windows-services
automatic checks should be created if they are found on a system.
These are also host rules.

The bulk of the rule sets determine parameters for specific check plug-ins.
An example is [.guihint]#Network interfaces and switch ports#.
The settings in these rules are tailored very specifically to their appropriate plug-in.
Such rule sets fundamentally only find use with those services that are based on this plug-in.
In case you are uncertain which rule set is responsible for which services, then you can best
find out by navigating directly via the service to the relevant rule.
How to do this will be explained later.

=== Host tags

One thing we have so far not mentioned: In the above example there is a rule for
all _test systems_. Where is it actually defined which host is a test system?

In {CMK}, something like _test system_ is known as a _host tag_.
You can freely-define your own tags, and some tags are already predefined.
Applying them to hosts is done either in the host’s detail mask or through inheritance
in the folder hierarchy. How to do this is explained in the link:wato_hosts.html[article on the hosts].
How to create your own tags, and what the predefined tags are about will be explained
link:wato_rules.html#hosttags[later] in this article.

== Determining the correct rule sets

=== Host rule sets

If you wish to create a new rule that defines a parameter for one or more hosts, there are several
ways to this end.
The direct way is via the icon:icon_rulesets[] [.guihint]#Host & service parameters# WATO module:

[{image-border}]
image::host_service_parameters.png[]

The quickest method is to use the _search field_. You also naturally need to know the rule set’s name.
Here as an example is a search for _host check_. The numbers show the number of rules already
present in the relevant rule sets:

[{image-border}]
image::search_host_ruleset.png[]

Another method is via the icon:button_parameters_host[] button in the details for an existing
host in WATO, or via the icon:icon_rulesets[] symbol in a folder’s list of hosts.
Here you will not only find all rule sets applicable to the host, but also the relevant parameters
currently in effect for this host.
In this example for [.guihint]#Host check command#, no rules apply to the host shown and thus it has
the default setting [.guihint]#PING (active check with ICMP echo request#:

image::host_rule_sets.png[]

Click on [.guihint]#Host check command# in order to see the complete rule set.

If a rule already exists, instead of the _Default value_ the number of the rule
defining this parameter appears.
Clicking on this takes you directly to the rule.

image::host_rule_sets2.png[]

[#checkparameters]
=== Service rule sets

The way to the rule sets for services is similar. The general access is also over
the icon:icon_rulesets[] [.guihint]#Host & service parameters# WATO module and
again via the search field.

If you are not yet very experienced with the rule sets’ names, then the procedure via the
service is simpler.
Similarly to the hosts, here there is also a page in which all of a service’s parameters are
shown and where you have the possibility of directly accessing the applicable rule sets.
You can access this parameter page with the icon:icon_rulesets[] symbol in a host’s
list of services in WATO.
The icon:icon_check_parameters[] symbol takes you directly to the rule set that defines
the link:wato_services.html#parameters[parameter for the check plug-in] for this service.

[{image-border}]
image::wato_service_list.png[]

By the way -- the icon:icon_rulesets[] symbol for the parameter page is also found in the status window in every service’s context menu:

[{image-border}]
image::service_context_menu.png[]

[#manual_checks]
=== Manual checks

A part of the rule sets is not included in the icon:icon_rulesets[] [.guihint]#Host & service parameters#
module, rather it is located in the icon:icon_static_checks[] [.guihint]#Manual checks# module.
This is not applicable to services that are created by a service discovery,
but rather to those that have been manually-created.
Relevant details may be found in the link:wato_services.html#manual_checks[article on services].

=== Rule sets in use

In the main dashboard under icon:icon_rulesets[] [.guihint]#Host & Service Parameters#
you will find the icon:button_used_rulesets[] button.
This displays all rule sets in which you have defined at least one rule.
This is often an easy starting point when you wish to make changes to your already existing rules.

Incidentally, a number of the rules will already have been created when
the {CMK} instance was installed, and they are a part of the WATO sample
configuration. These will also be displayed here.

=== Ineffective rules

Monitoring is a complex matter.
It can sometimes occur that there are rules that don’t apply to any hosts or services --
either because you have made an error, or because the associated hosts and services have disappeared.
Such ineffective rules can be displayed with the icon:button_ineffective_rulesets[] button.

=== Obsolete rule sets

{CMK} is constantly being developed. From time to time elements will be harmonised and it can occur
that some rule sets will be replaced by others.
An example is the harmonisation of all the check plug-ins that monitor temperature.
Since {CMK}’s Version 1.2.8, without exception these are configured with a single rule set.
A number of the previous rule sets have been rendered ineffective through this action.
Such rule sets can be found under icon:button_deprecated_rulesets[].
There you can also see if any of your defined rules are present, so that you can clone them in
appropriate new rule sets as needed.

[#create_rules]
== Creating and editing rules

The following image shows the [.guihint]#Filesystems (used space and growth)# rule set with four
rules configured:

[{image-border}]
image::rules_filesystem.png[]

*New rules* are created either with the [.guihint]#Create rule in folder# button, or by cloning an existing
rule with icon:button_clone[].
Cloning creates an identical copy of the rule that you can then edit with icon:icon_edit[].
A new rule created using the [.guihint]#Create rule in folder# button will always appear at the end of the list
of rules, whereas a cloned rule will be displayed as a copy below the original rule from which it was cloned.

The *sequence* in which the rules are listed can be changed with the
icon:icon_drag[] buttons. The sequence is important because rules positioned higher in
the list always have *priority* over those located lower.

The rules are stored in the same *link:wato_hosts.html#folder[folders]* from which you
also manage the hosts. The rules’ authorities are restricted to the hosts in this folder or in subfolders.
In the case of conflicting rules, the rule lower in the folder structure has priority.
In this way, for example, users with rights limited to certain link:wato_user.html#wato_permissions[authorised] folders
can create rules for their hosts without affecting the rest of the system.
In a rule's characteristics you can change its folder and thus ‘relocate’ it.

=== The analysis mode with ‘traffic lights’

When you access a rule set via a host or service -- for example, by using the icon:icon_rulesets[] or
icon:button_check_parameters[] symbols in the host or service -- WATO shows you the
rule set in the *analysis mode*:

[{image-border}]
image::rules_filesystem_analyze.png[]

This mode has two features. Firstly, a second button for setting rules
appears -- [.guihint]#Create mount point specific rule for# as an example here.
With this you can create a new rule which has the appropriate current host or service
already preselected. You can create an exceptional rule very easily and directly in this way.
Secondly, a ‘traffic light’ symbol appears in every line, the colour of which shows whether and/or
how this rule affects the current host, or respectively, service.
The following conditions are possible:

[cols="5,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_rulenmatch[] |This rule has no effect on the current host or service.
|icon:icon_rulematch[] |This rule accesses and defines parameters.
|icon:icon_ruleimatch[] |The rule is applicable. But because another rule higher in the hierarchy has priority this rule is ineffective.
|icon:icon_rulepmatch[] |This rule is applicable. Another rule higher in the hierarchy in fact has priority but  doesn’t define all parameters, so that at least one parameter is defined by this lower rule.
|===


In the last condition -- the rule is a icon:icon_rulepmatch[] partial match -- can only occur for
rule sets in which a rule can define *multiple parameters* by selecting individual check boxes.
Theoretically, every parameter for another rule can also be set individually here.
More on this later.

== Rule characteristics

=== General options

Every rule is assembled from three blocks. Everything in the first block, [.guihint]#Rule options#, is optional,
and serves primarily for documentation:

image::rules_props_properties.png[]

* The [.guihint]#Description# will be shown in the table of all rules in a rule set.
* The [.guihint]#Comment# field can be used for a longer description. It only appears in a rule’s edit mode. Via the icon:icon_insertdate[] symbol you can insert a date stamp and your login name in the text.
* The [.guihint]#Documentation-URL# is intended for a link to internal documentation that you maintain in another system (e.g., a CMDB). It will appear as the clickable icon:icon_url[] symbol in the rules table.
* With the [.guihint]#Do not apply this rule# check box you can temporarily disable this rule. It will then be flagged as icon:icon_disabled[] in the table and is thus ineffective.

=== The defined parameters

The second block is different for every rule. The following image shows a widely-used type of rule
([.guihint]#DB2 Tablespaces#).
Using check boxes you can determine which individual parameters the rule should define.
As described earlier, {CMK} ascertains, separately for each individual parameter,
which rules will set the parameters. The rule in the image simply defines one value,
and leaves all other settings unaffected.

image::rules_props_value_1.png[]

Some rule sets define no parameters, rather they only decide which hosts are
_in_ and which are not.  An example is the [.guihint]#Hosts to be monitored# rule
set with which you can remove some hosts completely from the monitoring. The
value area then looks like this:

image::rules_props_value_2.png[]

If you select [.guihint]#Make the outcome of the rule *positive*# here, this means that the affected hosts are
incorporated in bulk -- in our example, they will be monitored.

[#conditions]
=== Conditions

In the third block, [.guihint]#Conditions#, you can define for which hosts or services the rules should apply.
Here there are different conditions, all of which must be met in order for the rule to be applied.
The conditions are therefore logically AND-linked:

image::rules_props_conditions_1.png[]

==== Condition type

Here you have the option of using normal conditions as well
as _predefined conditions_.
These are managed with the [.guihint]#Predefined Conditions# WATO module.
Here you simply give fixed names to the rule matches that you need again and again,
and from then on simply refer to them in the rules. You can even
later change the content of these conditions centrally and all the rules will be
automatically-adjusted to suit. In the following example the predefined condition [.guihint]#No VM# has been selected:

image::rules_props_conditions_2.png[]

==== Folder

With the [.guihint]#Folder# condition you define that the rule only applies to hosts in this folder -- or subfolder.
If the setting is [.guihint]#Main Directory#, this condition is applicable to all hosts.
As described above, the folders have an effect on the rule’s sequence.
Rules in lower folders always have priority over higher ones.

==== Host tags
[.guihint]#Host tags# restrict rules to hosts according to whether they have -- or do not have -- specific host tags.
Here AND-links are also always used. Every other host tag condition in a rule reduces the number of
hosts affected by the rule.

If you wish to make a rule applicable for two possible values for a tag,
(for example, [.guihint]#Criticality# as well as [.guihint]#Productive system# and [.guihint]#Business critical#),
you cannot do this with a single rule. You will require a copy of the rule for every
variable. Sometimes a negation can also help here. You can also define that a tag is *not*
present as a condition (e.g., not [.guihint]#test system#). The so-called link:wato_rules.html#auxtags[auxiliary tags]
are another possibility.

Because some users really use many host tags, we have designed this
dialog so that not all tag groups are displayed by default.
You have to specifically select the one needed for the condition. It works like this:

. In the selection box choose a tags group.
. Click [.guihint]#Add tag condition# -- an entry for this group will then be added.
. Select [.guihint]#is# or [.guihint]#is not#.
. Select the desired comparison value.

image::rules_props_hosttags.png[]

==== Labels

You can also use the link:labels.html[Labels]
for conditions in rules. Include conditions with
[.guihint]#Add label condition# -- choose either [.guihint]#has# or [.guihint]#has not#
to formulate a positive or negative condition, and then enter
the label in the usual form _key_`:`_value_.
Please pay attention to the exact spelling here, and case-sensitivity
where applicable -- otherwise the condition will not work correctly.

image::rules_props_labels.png[]

==== Explicit hosts

This type of condition is intended for exception rules. Here you can list one or more host names.
The rule will apply only to these hosts.
Please note that if you check the [.guihint]#Specify explicit host names# box but enter *no* hosts,
then the rule will be completely ineffective.

Via the [.guihint]#Negate# option you can define a reversed-exception. With this you can exclude
explicitly-named hosts from the rule.

image::rules_props_explicithosts_1.png[]

Important: all host names entered here will be checked for *exact congruence*.
{CMK} is fundamentally case-sensitive!

You can change this behaviour to link:regexes.html[regular expressions] by prefixing host names with a tilde (`~`).
In this case, as always in WATO:

* The match is applied to the *beginning* of the host name
* The match is not case-sensitive

A point-asterisk (`pass:[.*]`) in link:regexes.html[regular expressions] allows an arbitrary sequence of characters
following the point. The following example shows a condition which all hosts will match whose names
*contain* the character sequence `my` (or `My`, `MY`, `mY` etc.):

image::rules_props_explicithosts_2.png[]

==== Explicit services

For rules that are applicable to services there is a last type of condition that defines a match
on a service’s name, or respectively -- for rules that set check parameters -- the *check item’s* name.
With what exactly the match will be made can be seen in the caption. In our example it is the name (instance)
of a [.guihint]#tablespace#:

image::rules_props_explicitservices.png[]

A match with link:regexes.html[regular expressions] fundamentally applies here.
The sequence `.*temp` matches all tablespaces *containing* `temp` because the match is always
applied to the start of the name. The dollar sign at the end of `transfer$` represents the end and thereby
forces an exact match. A tablespace with the name `transfer2` will thus *not* match.

Please don’t forget: for rules concerning [.guihint]#explicit services# a match with the service name is required
(e.g. `Tablespace transfer`).
For check parameter rules a match with the item applies (e.g. `transfer`).
The item is in fact the variable part of of the service name, and determines _to which_ tablespace it applies.

There are incidentally services without an item. An example is _CPU load_. This exists only once for each
host -- so no item is required. It follows then that rules for such check types are also without conditions.


[#matching]
== Types of rule analysis

In the introduction, regarding the principle of rules I wrote that the first applicable rule determines
the results of an analysis. That is not the whole truth -- there are altogether three different types of analysis:

[cols=2]
|===
|Analysis |Action 

|The first rule |The first rule that applies defines the value. Subsequent rules will not be analysed. This is the       normal situation with rules that set simple parameters.
|The first rule per parameter |Every individual parameter will be set by the first rule that defines this parameter (check box selected).       This is the normal situation for all rules with subparameters that are activated with check boxes.
|All rules |All applicable rules add elements to the results. This type is used for the allocation of hosts and       services to host, service and contact groups for example.
|===


This information is shown at the top of every rule set.

[{image-border}]
image::rules_matching_strategy.png[]

[#hosttags]
== Host tags in detail

As we have seen, the host tags are an important basis for defining rules. They are also however useful in
other locations. In link:views.html[views], for example, there is a filter for host tags.
The side bar element [.guihint]#Virtual host tree# can arrange your folders by host tags into a tree.
And on the command line, with many commands you can select all hosts having the `foo` tagline
by using the `@foo` syntax.

So that everything makes sense you should set up your own host tags scheme that optimally suits your environment.
But before we show you how you can define your own host tags with WATO, we should now explain a few terms.

[#auxtags]
=== Tag groups, check box tags, themes and auxiliary tags

Host tags are organised in *groups*. For this reason a host from every group can have a maximum
of one tag! A good example of an own group would be _Datacenter_, with the possible
tags _DC 1_ and _DC 2_. With these every host will be assigned to one or the other data centres.
Should you wish to install a host that is located in neither of the data centres you will need
a third option for selection -- for example, _Not in a datacenter_.

Some users have attempted to display the _application_ running on a host in a tag group.
One such group was called, let’s say, _Application_, and had the tags _ORACLE_, _SAP_,
_MS Exchange_, etc. ... This WILL work until the day a host has _two_ applications -- and that
day will certainly come!

The correct solution for this situation would be to create a tag group for each application, each with only
two options -- _yes_ or _no_.
{CMK} simplifies this by allowing you to create tag groups with only a _single_ tag.
These will not be shown as a selection field in the host mask, rather they will be displayed as a check box.
Selecting the check box sets a tag, otherwise the tag will not apply. Such tag groups are also
called *Checkboxtags*.

So that this doesn’t get confusing if you have many tag groups (e.g., because you have numerous
different applications), you can collate the tag groups into _Topics_. All tag groups with
the same topic will then be ...

* ... consolidated into their own box in the host details.
* ... displayed in the rule conditions as a list which can be expanded and collapsed using a small triangle icon.

The topics have ‘only’ an aid for visualisation function, and have no influence on the actual configuration.

*Auxiliary tags* solve the following problem: Imagine that you have defined an
_operating system_ tag group with the tags _Linux_, _AIX_,
_Windows 2008_ and _Windows 2012_.
Now you want to define a rule which will be valid for all Windows hosts.
This cannot work, because in a situation as described above you can only ever choose one tag per group.

In order to get around this problem you can define a _Windows_ auxiliary tag.
Assign this auxiliary tag to both the _Windows 2008_ and the
_Windows 2012_ tags. A host that possesses either of these tags will always _automatically_
receive the _Windows_ auxiliary tag from WATO. In the rules, _Windows_ will appear as its own tag
for formulating conditions.

=== Predefined tags

During installation, {CMK} furnishes you with numerous tag groups:

[cols=2]
|===
|Tag group |Function 

|_Agent type_ |Defines what type of data the host receives from its link:wato_monitoringagents.html[agents].
|_Criticality_ |The system’s service level. For the _Do not monitor this host_ tag a predefined rule is provided  which will disable the host monitoring. The other tags are merely examples without function.  You can however assign these to hosts and then use them in rules.
|_Networking segment_ |Treat this tag group only as an example. For the _WAN (high latency)_ tag an example rule is  deposited which matches the thresholds for PING response times to the higher message latency in WAN.
|_IP Address Family_ |Defines whether the host should be monitored per IPv4 or IPv6, or both. The group has the  status _builtin_ and can not be modified. This is necessary as the tags are required internally by  {CMK} during the creation of the configuration.
|[.guihint]#SNMP# |This determines whether SNMP data is evaluated.
|Piggyback |This characteristic defines whether and how piggyback data is expected/processed for corresponding hosts.
|===


==== Modifying predefined tag groups

You can theoretically customise the predefined tag groups as long as they are not marked
as [.guihint]#builtin#. Modifications in [.guihint]#Criticality# or [.guihint]#Network Segment# are non-critical as
these are only provided as examples.
The [.guihint]#Agent type# group should under no circumstances be altered or extended -- even though
it is not marked as [.guihint]#builtin#! The tags for this group are referenced internally by {CMK}.

=== Editing tag groups using WATO

Creating your own tags is achieved using the icon:icon_hosttag[] [.guihint]#Host tags# WATO module.
Depending on the {CMK} version, in a freshly-installed system it will look something like this:

[{image-border}]
image::rules_hosttags_main.png[]

Creating a new tag group is performed with the icon:button_new_taggroup[] button,
which opens the following input masks:

image::rules_hosttags_config_properties.png[]

The *[.guihint]#Tag group ID#* is used internally to identify the tag group.
This must be explicit and may not be subsequently changed.
The standard syntax for permitted characters applies (only letters, digits, underscore).

The *[.guihint]#Title#* will be used everywhere in the GUI in connection with the tag group.
Because this is purely a display text it can be changed at any time without affecting the
existing configuration.

You can leave *[.guihint]#Topic#* blank. Your tag group will then be displayed with the predefined
groups. You can also create your own topics and use these to arrange your tags clearly in a summary.

The *[.guihint]#Choices#* in the next box are naturally of most importance.

image::rules_hosttags_config_choices.png[]

It is essential that
the appropriate *[.guihint]#Tag ID#* is explicit -- not only within the group but
also across all groups! In case of doubt you can simply work with prefixes --
e.g., `loc_dc1` -- instead of only `dc1`.

The sequence -- which you can as usual change with the
icon:icon_drag[] button -- has only a visual function --
*the first tag in the list is deemed to be the default value!*
That means that all hosts without an explicit setting for this tag group will be
automatically set to this value.

Under *[.guihint]#Auxiliary tags#* you can apply auxiliary tags to a tag that should be
automatically added to the host by WATO when this tag is selected.

=== Editing Auxiliary tags

You can create new Auxiliary tags with icon:button_auxtag_new[]. As usual
you assign a fixed ID and an informative title in the following dialog. You
can add a [.guihint]#Topic# in the same way as in the tag groups.

image::rules_hosttags_auxtag_basic.png[]

The assignment and the usage of these auxiliary tags is then done directly
in the options for the tag groups itself.


=== Deleting and modifying existing tags and tag groups

Modifying an existing tag group configuration appears to be a simple operation at first --
but that is unfortunately not always the case, as it can have big impacts on an
existing configuration. Changes that solely affect the display or only add new selections
are no problem and have no effect on the existing hosts and rules:

* A change to the title or topic of tags and tag groups
* Adding an additional tag to a tag group

All other changes can impact existing hosts or rules that use the affected tags.
WATO not only forbids such changes, it also attempts to adapt your existing configuration so
that everything again functions effectively. What exactly that means depends on the type of operation.

==== Deleting tag groups

Information from the affected tags will be erased from all hosts.
If the tag group is used as a condition in existing rules you will receive the follwing warning:

image::rules_hosttags_delete.png[]

Here you need to decide whether you wish to _remove the conditions_ from the existing
rules or whether you wish to delete the rules completely.
Both actions can make sense, but WATO cannot decide which action is better for you.
If uncertain, you should go through the rule set (linked via the warning) and manually
delete or modify all of the conditions for the affected group as needed.

==== Deleting single tags

Deleting tags is achieved by editing the group, removing the tag and then saving the data.
This action can trigger a similar warning to that when deleting a tag group.

Hosts that had set the affected tag will be automatically reset to the default value.
This will always be (as described above) the top tag in the list.

Rules that have a _negative_ condition for the Tag simply lose this condition,
without comment. If you have, for example, a rule for all hosts that *don't* have
the `loc_dc2` tag, and you delete the `loc_dc2` tag completely from the
configuration, then this condition is obviously superfluous.

If however a _positive_ condition with the tag exists, you will receive the above warning
and must decide how to adapt the configuration.

==== Renaming Tag-IDs

Unlike those in tag groups, you can in fact change the IDs of tags retrospectively. This is, so to
speak, an exception to the {CMK} principle that IDs once set are unchangeable.
It can however be useful if you want to prepare an import of data from an existing system
for which you need to accommodate a different tag scheme.

To rename tag-IDs, go into the tag group’s edit mode and there simply change the IDs,
but *leaving the title unaltered* in doing so. This last point is important so that
{CMK} recognises that a rename has occured rather than simply an option being removed and a new
one added.

Before {CMK} executes the changes to the configuration, it will inform you of the consequences:

WATO will now update all relevant hosts, folders and rules as appropriate.

Please be aware that there can nonetheless be situations in which manual corrections need to be made
in some locations. So, for example, Tag-IDs are components of URLs which summon views that filter by tags.
WATO cannot alter these URLs for you. Likewise, filter configurations in reports and dashboards
cannot be automatically updated. It is also a good idea at the beginning to give enough thought to the
tag scheme so that possible later renames can be minimised.


=== Constructing a tree-view from host tags

In {CMK} hosts are usually organised in folders, which
results in a natural hierarchy. You can display this as a tree view via the
display sidebar [.guihint]#Folders# snapin, and from there the standard view
calls the hosts, filtered per branch. The [.guihint]#Tree of Folders# snapin
complements this tree with filter options for topics and options for
different views. You can also create such a tree view
with link:wato_rules.html#hosttags[host tags], and thus generate a ‘virtual’
hierarchy-map -- using the [.guihint]#Virtual Host Tree# snapin. In addition to the
host tags you can also incorporate the folder structure in such trees in which
both the number of virtual trees and their respective branches
is unlimited.

Suppose that you have created the three tag groups _place_,
_device class_ and _operating system_ for your hosts. On
the top tree level you will then see a selection of the locations, including the device classes,
and ultimately the operating systems. Each level of the hierarchy takes you straight to a
view of all hosts which have these tags.

To create a virtual host tree, first add the snap-in
using icon:button_sidebar_add_snapin[] in the bottom left of the sidebar.

Then call up the settings via [.guihint]#WATO > Global Settings > User Interface > Virtual Host Trees#,
and create a new tree with [.guihint]#Create new virtual host tree configuration#.

Then assign an ID and Title to the tree, and optionally exclude empty tree branches at the
[.guihint]#Exclude empty tag choices# check box. Then with [.guihint]#Add new element#
add the desired tag groups in the desired order. If you have the folder hierarchy as the top level,
simply start with [.guihint]#WATO folder tree#. As usual, the order/hierarchy in the display you can of course later
change using the handles.

Save and apply the changes -- and the new tree structure will immediately provide several new views.
