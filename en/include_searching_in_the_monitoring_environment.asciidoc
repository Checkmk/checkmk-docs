In the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu you can search for hosts and services. 
The search is interactive, so as soon as you have typed something, you will immediately see the results matching your input below the search field:

The search function in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu is identical to that offered to you by the [.guihint]#Quicksearch# snapin.

Here are a few tips for searching:

* Upper and lower case is not relevant to the search -- with the exception of the search for labels, which are only found if they are entered exactly as they are called in the syntax `key:value`.

* You can work freely with keywords, e.g. search for `pending service`.

* But you can also use filters to search for patterns within hostnames (with `h:`), patterns within service names (with `s:`) and you can combine the two. 
A search for `s:boot` will show you all services that contain `boot` and a search for `h:win s:cpu` will show you all services that contain `cpu` on any hosts that contain `win`.

* You do not have to select an entry from the suggestion list. 
After entering your search term, simply press the Enter key and you will receive the appropriate result on the main page in the form of a list of all hosts and/or services.

* You can save the search query in a bookmark.
