== What are reports?

{cee-only}
In {CMK}, a report is a compilation of diverse elements -- xref:views#[views], xref:availability#[availability tables], xref:graphing#[graphs], text, logos, etc., into a printable PDF document.
You can use reports in the {CEE}.


=== Characteristics of reports

* No external tool such as Jasper, DB, or similar is necessary.
* The PDF file is cleanly rendered with vector graphics.
* Reports can be managed using templates and by basing them on preformatted master copies.
* The xref:scheduler[report scheduler] can send reports periodically as required.
* Instant reports can be produced using the [.guihint]#Export > This view as PDF# menu item.

.Views can be exported as PDF at any time

== The Reporting snapin in the sidebar

Via the [.guihint]#Reporting# snapin in the xref:user_interface#sidebar[sidebar] you get quick access to all reports and to the xref:scheduler[report scheduler].

.Quick access can be added to the sidebar
image::reporting_sidebar.png[alt="'Reporting' snapin in the sidebar.",width=55%]

There are three buttons in this snapin:

[cols="30,~"]
|===

|[.guihint]#Change Timerange# |Change the time range for instant reports
|[.guihint]#Scheduler# |Open the report scheduler
|[.guihint]#Edit# |Open a list of available reports
|===


== Global defaults for reports

You configure the global defaults for reports via [.guihint]#Setup > Global settings > Reporting#.

.Settings like templates and font sizes can be set globally
image::reporting_global_settings.png[alt="Global settings for reports."]


[#customize_existing_reports]
== Customizing existing reports

As with xref:views#[table views] and xref:dashboards#[dashboards], supplied standard reports cannot be changed – however an existing report can be cloned, and the clone can then be customised as desired.

You can get to the list of all available reports via [.guihint]#Customize > Business reporting > Reports#:

.Some of the already integrated reports
image::reporting_list.png[alt="List of reports."]

On the left side these icons are ready to use for the editing:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_clone[] |Copy report
|icon:icon_pdf[] |Open preview
|icon:icon_reportscheduler[] |Open the xref:scheduler[report scheduler]
|===


=== Basic settings

Clicking the icon:icon_clone[alt=] will clone the report and open a menu for editing the basic settings for the new report:

.Settings of the cloned report [.guihint]#Report of Host#.
image::reporting_general_properties.png[alt="Form for general settings of a report."]

As a minimum, enter values for [.guihint]#Unique ID# and [.guihint]#Title#.
If you want to make the report available for other users, enable the [.guihint]#Make this report available for other users# option.
You can then share the report with all users or only with members of specific contact groups.
If you do not want the report to be available for selection in the main navigation, use the [.guihint]#Hide this report in the monitor menu# option.

Switch to the [.guihint]#Report Properties# box.
Here values for font, page format, time and date settings, the report's layout and the file name for downloads can be defined.

.At this point you can specify basic corporate identity guidelines.
image::reporting_report_properties.png[alt="Form for layout preferences of a report."]

In the final [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# box, you have extensive filtering options as usual, from specific hosts, to individual Docker containers, to values from Oracle monitoring.

Once all values have been defined as required, continue with one of the items from the [.guihint]#Report > Save this report and go to# menu.

[cols="30,~"]
|===

|[.guihint]#List of reports# |Save configuration and go back to the report list
|[.guihint]#Elements# |Save configuration and go to report elements configuration
|[.guihint]#Generate# |Save configuration and generate report immediately
|===

After saving your report will be displayed in the list.

.Copied reports can of course be modified and deleted.
image::reporting_list_cloned.png[alt="List entry of a cloned report."]

For editing your own reports you can use the following functions:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_clone[] |Copy report
|icon:icon_delete[] |Delete report
|icon:icon_edit[] |Edit report settings
|icon:button_report_element_lo[] |Edit report contents
|icon:icon_pdf[] |Display preview
|icon:icon_reportscheduler[] |Open the xref:scheduler[report scheduler]
|===


=== Report elements

Clicking icon:button_report_element_lo[] opens an overview
of the selected report.

.Preview with error messages due to missing context.
image::reporting_content_overview.png[alt="Preview and overview of a report."]

On the left side a preview of the report is shown, here for the report of [.guihint]#Report of Host cloned.#
To the right the report's elements are listed.
These elements are edited with the icons icon:icon_edit[], copied icon:icon_clone[], deleted icon:icon_delete[] and reordered icon:icon_drag[].

*Tip:* In the preview, you will see red lines and error messages instead of real data -- because, of course, the report in the editor lacks context, here in this example, the specification of a host, which would only be revealed by calling the report from an appropriate view.
If you want to see a usable preview, simply filter for a specific host in the report settings in the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# area in the meantime: this makes designing much easier:

.Preview with real data for a filtered host
image::reporting_content_overview_filtered.png[alt="Report preview with real data."]

Add new elements to the report using the [.guihint]#Reports# menu with the [.guihint]#Add content# and [.guihint]#Add page element# items.
The latter are pure design elements for pages: Horizontal line, image, page border and a single line of text.
You can display these elements on all or specific pages of your report.

You add the actual content via [.guihint]#Add content# -- for example tables, graphs, tables of contents or texts (also via macros or HTTP).
These contents appear one after the other and thus also determine the final length of the report.

.Excerpt of content modules for reports
image::reporting_content_elements.png[alt="Excerpt of report elements."]


=== Inserting an image

Images which are to be included in a report must be in the `local/share/check_mk/reporting/images` folder.

Click on the [.guihint]#Add page element# button, then select [.guihint]#Embedded image# as type, and finally [.guihint]#Continue#.

.Here images are inserted as _'fixed page element'_.
image::reporting_image_add.png[alt="Dialog for selecting an image element."]

The following dialogs are used to define detail settings such as position, file name and size.

.Size specifications in millimeters for easy print design
image::reporting_image_properties.png[alt="Dialog for image properties."]

Once all of the settings have been defined, complete this process by clicking [.guihint]#Save#. 
This will return to the report overview in which the added image will be visible in the report's preview.


=== Changing the report’s logo

Copy your company logo into the `local/share/check_mk/reporting/images` folder and save it as file `logo_mk.png`.
The logo will with immediate effect begin to appear on all reports.


[#create_reports]
== Creating new reports

You create a new report on the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# page via [.guihint]#Reports > Add report#.

In the first step, you can set a filter and limit the report to a specific host or data source from the start, such as network interfaces, BI aggregates, sensors, and so on:

.Most of the time you will not need the filters at this level
image::reporting_new.png[alt="List of filters for limiting the report."]

Usually you will be able to use the default [.guihint]#No restrictions to specific objects#.

After that, only what you already know comes up -- further customization of the report is the same as in xref:customize_existing_reports[customizing existing reports] shown above.


[#views]
== Inserting views and history graphs into reports

Now, if you want to include a history graph or view in one of your reports, simply call the view you want and filter on the results you want, if necessary.
Then all you have to do is call up your report via the [.guihint]#Export# menu and you will end up directly in the PDF.

.Own reports also end up in the [.guihint]#Export# menu -- if not explicitly excluded
image::reporting_exportmenu.png[alt="'Export' menu with entries for custom reports."]


[#scheduler]
== The report scheduler

You can use the report scheduler to automatically create and send existing reports.
You can reach the scheduler on the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# page via [.guihint]#Reports > Scheduler.#

Create a new schedule with [.guihint]#Add schedule#, then select the report and click [.guihint]#Continue#.

In the [.guihint]#General Options# box you specify basic settings which can be defined, such as title, creation time, report time frame, recipient and so on:

.For example, you can have a weekly report automatically sent to you via PDF on Friday afternoons.
image::reporting_schedule.png[alt="Report scheduler settings."]

Under [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# you will then again find the usual filter options, depending on the report you have selected.
Then save the report to return to the list of your scheduled reports.

In the list you will also find information on when the report was last generated/sent, whether an error occurred, when it will next be generated/sent, and more (slightly shortened here):

.A scheduled report with detailed, here slightly abbreviated, information.
image::reporting_schedule_list.png[alt="List of scheduled reports."]

Entries in the list are managed using the five icons at the beginning of the list:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_edit[] |Edit report settings
|icon:icon_clone[] |Copy report settings
|icon:icon_delete[] |Delete scheduled report
|icon:icon_pdf[] |Create report
|icon:icon_pdfpreview[] |Display preview
|===

*Note:* Dispatched reports are not saved in the site.

== Files and directories
