== What are reports?

{cee-only}
A report in {CMK} is intended to provide an overview of the data, content, and state in {CMK} in printable form. It is a compilation of different elements (xref:views#[table views], xref:availability#[availability tables], xref:graphing#[history graphs], body text, logos) into a printable PDF document.

image::reporting_report.png[alt="Example of a report.", width=70%]

Reports in {CMK} are easy to use:

* No external tools like Jasper, DB or similar are needed.
* The PDF file is cleanly created with vector graphics.
* Reports can be managed using templates and inheritance.
* The xref:reporting#scheduler[report scheduler] sends reports periodically on demand.
* Instant reports are generated via [.guihint]#Export > This view as PDF#.
* Views can be exported as PDF at any time

image::reporting_menu_export.png[alt="Expanded 'Export' menu with the entry for PDF creation."]


== Pre-built reports in {CMK}

The {CEE} provide some pre-built reports. You can either use these directly to get reports from {CMK}, or use them as templates for xref:create_reports[own reports] at any time.


=== Contents and usage

Just like xref:views#[table views] and xref:dashboards#[dashboards], reports supplied in {CMK} cannot be modified.
But you can clone/copy any existing reports as many times as you like, and modify each to suit your needs. The procedure for creating xref:create_reports[simple] but also xref:complex_reports[complex] reports is described below.


==== Which reports are available?

An overview of all reports, pre-built and custom, in {CMK} can be found at [.guihint]#Customize > Business reporting > Reports# (you may need to click [.guihint]#show more# first):

Some of the prefabricated reports
image::reporting_list.png[alt="List of reports."]

On the left side, the following icons are available for editing:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_clone[alt="Icon for copying a report."] |Copy report.
|icon:icon_pdf[alt="Icon to create a report preview."] |View preview.
|icon:icon_reportscheduler[alt="Symbol to open report scheduler."] |xref:scheduler [Open report scheduler].
|===


=== Launching reports

Reports can be launched at various points in {CMK}, depending on their context and purpose. For example, designated reports can be called from the main menu.

image::reporting_main_menu.png[alt="Selecting reports from the main menu."]

Contextually, you can find the reports in the [.guihint]#Export# menu of the various views:

image::reporting_exportmenu_original.png[alt="View of reports in Export menu."]


==== Quick access to reports - Snapin reporting in sidebar
The snapin [.guihint]#reporting# in the xref:user_interface#sidebar[sidebar] gives you quick access to all reports that have been designated for display in the main menu and sidebar, and the xref:scheduler[report scheduler] [.guihint]#(scheduler):#

You can add the quick access to the sidebar.
image::reporting_sidebar.png[alt="Snapin 'Reporting' in the sidebar.",width=45%]

There are three buttons in this snapin:

[cols="30,~"]
|===

|[.guihint]#Change Timerange# |Change Timerange for Instant Reports
|[.guihint]#Scheduler# |xref:scheduler#[Open report scheduler]
|[.guihint]#Edit# |Open list of existing reports
|===


==== Context for reports

To give reports a context, i.e. to fill them with data of specific hosts and services, there are several possibilities. As a result, reports have to be called in different ways to contain meaningful information.
If the context is missing, i.e. specifying which hosts and services should be included in the report, you will only get error messages highlighted in red instead of correct output:

image::reporting_output_red.png[alt="Output of a report with unspecified data.", width=79%]

The difference is where the context is specified:

* Context specified (via report properties): The report can be called from anywhere, it is always filled with correct information.
* Context not given: Call via [.guihint]#Export# menu in the different views, context is provided by the (filtered) view.

image::reporting_output_nored.png[alt="Output of a report with specified data.", width=78%]

Now think again about the snapin [.guihint]#Reporting# mentioned above: this takes you directly to the rendered reports without any further preselection / restriction etc. - so actually only those reports that have a _built-in_ context make sense here.

Reports whose context is only created via (filtered) views can therefore be safely excluded from the main menu as well as the snapin via the [.guihint]#Hide this report in the monitor menu# option.

image::reporting_general_properties_view2.png[alt="Selection to hide the report in the main menu and snapin."]


=== Create your own reports - basics.

Based on the existing reports and report templates, you can create your first custom report relatively quickly and easily. We will explain how to do this in a moment. More in-depth information around more complex reports will follow xref:complex_reports[below] in the text.


[#create_reports]
==== Create a first custom report

The fastest way to create a report is to copy an existing report and then customize it.
For example, if you want to create an overview of the availability of services on a specific host, the host named mycmkserver, do the following.

First, open the report overview with [.guihint]#Customize > Business reporting > Reports#:

image::reporting_list_selection.png[alt="Selection from the list of reports."]

Clicking icon:icon_clone[alt="Icon to copy a report."] in front of the report [.guihint]#service_availability# will take you to the basic settings of your report copy:

image::reporting_general_properties_simple.png[alt="Entering the basic settings of a report."]

Enter the desired texts for [.guihint]#Unique ID# and [.guihint]#Title#. We won't deal with the other options in this box, as well as the [.guihint]#Report Properties#, until we get to the xref:complex_reports[more complex reports].

For now, it's enough to scroll down to the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# box. For [.guihint]#Host#, select [.guihint]#Hostname#. Now, once you click [.guihint]#Add filter#, you can select the appropriate host from the list of hostnames:

image::reporting_filter_host.png[alt="Selecting the appropriate host for the report."]

Click icon:icon_save[alt="Save icon."] to save your report and return to the reports overview page. In the section [.guihint]#Customized# you can now directly access your new report by clicking on the title:

image::reporting_customized.png[alt="View of custom report."]

==== Editing functions
You can use the following functions to edit your own reports:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_clone[] |Copy report
|icon:icon_delete[] |Delete report
|icon:icon_edit[] |Edit report settings
|icon:button_report_element_lo[] |Edit report contents
|icon:icon_pdf[] |Display previews
|icon:icon_reportscheduler[] |Schedule regular report
|===

A description of the different possibilities follows in the subsequent chapters.


==== Create a new report without a template
Things get a little more complex now if you want to create a completely new report instead of a report copy. As an example, below you will create a simple overview of all problematic services of your instance, i.e. all services in {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN} status. This overview will be titled "critical_services".

You create a new report on the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# page via [.guihint]#Reports > Add report#.

image::reporting_add_report.png[alt="Open a new report.", width=38%]

In the first step, leave the filter [.guihint]#Select specific object type# on the selection [.guihint]#No restrictions to specific objects# and go directly to the next selection with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to continue."] [.guihint]#Continue#.

image::reporting_no_specific_objects.png[alt="Keep selection 'No restriction to specific objects'."]

As with copying an existing report, first specify [.guihint]#Unique ID# and [.guihint]#Title#.

image::reporting_general_properties2.png[alt="Assigning unique ID and title for the new report."]

In the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# section, now select the [.guihint]#Service states# under [.guihint]#Service#. After clicking [.guihint]#Add filter# you can set the desired states:

image::reporting_search_filters.png[alt="Selecting service states for the report."]

With icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to save."] [.guihint]#Save & go to list# the new report will be added to the _Customized_ section of the reports overview list.

image::reporting_customized2.png[alt="View custom report in overview."]

If you now call up this report in joyful anticipation, the result is sobering. The report page has an initial layout and also a heading, but is otherwise empty. Not exactly the result to impress your boss with ...

image::reporting_empty_report.png[alt="Amnview of the empty report."]

So now you need to define the design of the content for the report. The icon:icon_edit_report[alt="Icon for editing the report content."] will take you to the content definition for the report. The selection of report elements is done in three stages, each with a click on icon:icon_save[alt="Symbol for proceeding in the process."] [.guihint]#Continue# in between.

Start by clicking [.guihint]#Add content#. For this example in [.guihint]#Step 1# select the element type _Availability table._ Set [.guihint]#Step 2# to the selection _All services_ and [.guihint]#Step 3# to the selection _No restrictions to specific objects_. Leave the other options on the following page unchanged for the moment. Instead, click directly on icon:icon_save[alt="icon to save."] [.guihint]#Save#. Now view the preview of your report:

image::reporting_content_output.png[alt="View first custom element."]

On the left you can see the preview, here for the report [.guihint]#critical_services.#.
To the right, the elements of the report are displayed in a list.
These elements can be edited icon:icon_edit[], copied icon:icon_clone[], deleted icon:icon_delete[] and reordered icon:icon_drag[].


You can now flexibly extend this simple, self-created report with additional elements (see below) and call it up at any time, e.g. from the sidebar.

[#complex_reports]
=== Building complex reports
In the previous sections you have seen how to create initial reports with little effort, either as a copy of an existing report or completely new. These are great for achieving initial success. Most of the time, however, it doesn't stop at such simply structured reports. More complex presentations, a mixture of different content, a custom layout, etc. are the next logical step.

The many possibilities can best be shown with an example.

image::reporting_complex_report.png[alt="."]

==== Set basic settings
In almost every step of the report creation there is the possibility to adjust the content to your needs.

In the first step, you can set a filter and limit the report to a specific host or data source from the start, such as network interfaces, BI aggregates, sensors, and so on:

.Most of the time, however, you will not need the filters at this level
image::reporting_specific_objects.png[alt="List of filters to restrict the report."]

Next, enter the [.guihint]#Unique ID# and the [.guihint]#Title# again. For the title you can also use the provided xref:macros[macros] (=text modules). Next, choose a [.guihint]#Icon# with which the report should be visible in the menus. By setting the [.guihint]#Make this report available for other users# option to the contact group, in the example: check-mk-notify, you give the associated group members the ability to independently access the report at any time and get information on their own.


image::reporting_general_properties_complex.png[alt="Setting the more complex basic properties for the report."]

In the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# box, extensive filtering options are available as usual, from specific hosts to individual Docker containers to values from Oracle monitoring.

image::reporting_context_search_filters.png[alt="Selection for report content design."]

For this example, the host selection is limited to one folder and additionally to specified host issues. This restriction speeds up data retrieval, especially in more complex environments.

With [.guihint]#Save & go to list# you get to the report overview. The next step is to define the report content.

==== Define report content
Using the icon:button_report_element_lo[] you get to the content design.

image::reporting_edit_content.png[alt="Calling content design."]

Open report content editing with [.guihint]#Reports > Add content#. Use this to add tables, graphs, tables of contents, or text (also via macros or HTTP) to the report, for example. These contents appear one after the other and thus also determine the final length of the report.

.a list of all page elements can be found in the xref:further_elements[overview of content and page elements].
image::reporting_add_content.png[alt="Adding a content element.", width=58%]

In step 1, select the element you want, for this example [.guihint]#Multiple graphs#. This will give you, depending on your other settings, multiple graphs of the same type one below the other. For example, you can map the direct comparison between the states of multiple hosts.

image::reporting_step1.png[alt="Selecting a graph."]

Continue with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to proceed."] [.guihint]#Continue#. As the data source for the graphics, select [.guihint]#All services# in step 2 for this example, i.e. all services running on the hosts:

image::reporting_step2.png[alt="Data source selection."]

Continue with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to proceed."] [.guihint]#Continue#. In step 3 you could now limit the amount of data to be displayed. This is not needed for the current example. Again, switch to the next selection with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to skip."] [.guihint]#Continue#.

image::reporting_properties_context.png[alt="Setting various properties."]

For the sample report, in the [.guihint]#Properties# box, under [.guihint]#Graph layout#, specify that you want to see a title for each of the graphs, consisting of the graph title, host name, and service description. In addition, set the displayed time range to four hours under [.guihint]#Graph time range#.

In the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# box, you limit the report to specified host or service characteristics. Here you select the CPU usage for the [guihint]#Service# this time.

By clicking icon:icon_save[alt="icon to save."] [.guihint]#Save# you have completed the first report element.

For the second graph in the example, start again with [.guihint]#Reports > Add content# and in [.guihint]#Step 1# select [.guihint]#Metrics graph of a single service#. Switch to [.guihint]#Step 2# with icon:icon_save[alt="icon to skip."] [.guihint]#Continue# and restrict the search filters to host and service description:

image::reporting_context_search_filters2.png[alt="Selecting host and service description."]

By clicking icon:icon_save[alt="icon to save."] [.guihint]#Save# the second report element is ready.

The third element you create is an overview of current alerts. The procedure remains the same:

* Call [.guihint]#Reports > Add content#.
* Step 1: Selection of the element [.guihint]#Availability table#
* Step 2: Data source [.guihint]#Alert Statistics#
* Step 3: Restrict to [.guihint]#Restrict to a single host#
* no further options in the following step

With a click on icon:icon_save[alt="icon to save."] [.guihint]#Save# this report element is also finished.

To make the display cleaner, add headings:

Open [.guihint]#Reports > Add content# to edit the report content. In [.guihint]#Step 1# select [.guihint]#Heading# as element type. Switch to [.guihint]#Step 2# with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to skip."] [.guihint]#Continue#. Optionally, specify a hierarchy level for the heading. Enter the heading at [.guihint]#The text#.

image::reporting_add_heading.png[alt="Entering the heading."]

Click icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to save."] [.guihint]#Save# to return to the overview. However, the new heading is now below the graphics in the order. Therefore, click the corresponding icon:icon_drag[] in the list of content items and move the heading to the desired position in the list.

image::reporting_content_overview.png[alt="Editing view of the report with red elements."]

*Tip:* In the preview, you may see red lines and error messages instead of real data -- because in these places the report in the editor lacks context, here, for example, the specification of a host that would only be revealed by calling the report from an appropriate view.
If you want to see a usable preview, simply filter for a specific host in the report settings in the [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# area in the meantime, this makes designing much easier.

image::reporting_content_overview2.png[alt="Editing view of the report without red elements."]

[#views]
===== Visual design of the report

To structure the report, there are complementary design elements: Horizontal line, image, page frame and a single line of text. You can display these building blocks on all or specific pages of your report.

For the example report, insert a frame around the report. Again, the definition is done step by step, each continued by clicking icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to skip."]. Start with [.guihint]#Reports > Add page element#.

.For a listing of all page elements, see xref:further_elements[overview of content and page elements].
image::reporting_step1_fixed.png[alt="Frame selection."]

Since the frame should be visible on all pages, the next step requires no changes:

image::reporting_placement.png[alt="Selection of placement."]

The new page border is now displayed in the overview, both in the preview on the left and in the static page elements table on the right.

image::reporting_content_overview3.png[alt="Current overview of the report."]

*Tip:* You can also use the xref:macros[macros] (=text modules) available in {CMK}, for example, to create another footer with page number and name of the report. To do this, select the page element [.guihint]#One line of text# and in the second step specify the position at the bottom of the page as well as the text including the desired macros: 

image::reporting_footer.png[alt="."]


==== Customize the layout
Reports look more appealing right away with a higher-quality appearance, e.g. with the company logo added.

Open the report settings with [.guihint]#Reports > Edit properties#:

image::reporting_edit_properties.png[alt="Selecting the 'Edit properties' option.", width=62%]

In the second box, you will find the [.guihint]#Report Properties.# here.
This is where you configure values for font, page format, time and date settings, report layout, and file name for downloads.

At this point you can specify basic design features
image::reporting_report_properties2.png[alt="Report layout preferences form."]

Copy your company logo to the `local/share/check_mk/reporting/images` directory and save it as `logo_mk.png` file.
From now on this logo will be displayed on all reports.

image::reporting_own_logo.png[alt="View of report header with custom logo.", width=80%]

*Note:* Currently, you customize the existing report template to suit your needs. Alternatively, you can create a xref:new_template[complete, new report template] according to your company specifications, e.g. to reflect the company's corporate design.

===== Insert an additional image

Images that you want to use as design elements in your reports must have been previously stored in the 'local/share/check_mk/reporting/images' directory.

Click the [.guihint]#Add page element# button in the report creation.

image::reporting_add_page_element.png[alt="Call to select image elements.", width=71%]

In the following [.guihint]#Step 1#, select [.guihint]#Embedded image# as type and continue with icon:icon_save[alt="Icon to continue."] [.guihint]#Continue#. (A listing of all elements)

.For a listing of all page elements, see xref:further_elements[overview of content and page elements].
image::reporting_image_add.png[alt="Dialog for selecting an image element."]

The following dialog is used to set detail settings such as position, filename and size.

.sizes in millimeters for easy print design
image::reporting_image_properties.png[alt="Dialog for image properties."]

When you are done with all settings, save with icon:icon_save[alt="icon to save."] [.guihint]#Save.#
After that you will get to the report overview and see the inserted image in the report.

image::reporting_own_pic.png[alt="View of report header with custom logo.", width=80%]



[#scheduler]
=== Schedule report

You can use the report scheduler to have existing reports created and sent automatically.
You can reach the scheduler on the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# page via [.guihint]#Reports > Scheduler.#

==== Send a report regularly

Open a new schedule using [.guihint]#Scheduled reports > Add schedule#, then select the report and click icon:icon_save[alt="icon to continue."] [.guihint]#Continue#.

In the [.guihint]#General Options# box, you specify basic settings such as title, creation time, reporting period, and so on:

.for example, you can have a weekly report automatically sent to you via PDF on Friday afternoons.
image::reporting_schedule.png[alt="Report scheduler settings."]

Under [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# you will find the usual filter options, depending on the selected report.
Then save the report to return to the list of your scheduled reports.

In the list you will also find information about the last time the report was generated/sent, if there was an error, when it will be generated/sent the next time and some more (slightly shortened here):

.A scheduled report with detailed, here slightly shortened, information.
image::reporting_schedule_list.png[alt="List of scheduled reports."]

Entries in the list are managed using the five icons at the top of the list:

[cols="10,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_edit[] |Edit report settings
|icon:icon_clone[] |Copy report settings
|icon:icon_delete[] |Delete scheduled report
|icon:icon_pdf[] |Create report
|icon:icon_pdfpreview[] |Display preview
|===

*Note:* Sent reports are not stored in the instance.

==== Store a report locally on a regular basis.

Instead of sending the report, you can also store it locally. To do this, select the [.guihint]#Action - Store locally#:

image::reporting_general_options_local.png[alt="Parameters for storing a report locally."]

Then set a file name and optionally a report title. To be able to build a history of reports - instead of overwriting the previous version every time the report is created, {CMK} provides various xref:macros[macros] (=text modules).

The overview of all locally stored reports can be accessed in the [.guihint]#Edit Reports# window via the [.guihint]#Reports > Stored reports# menu item:

image::reporting_reports_storedreports.png[alt="Calling stored reports.", width=34%]



=== Global defaults for reports

Some basic settings for reports can be set globally, for example to create and manage a corporate design centrally. Settings for an individual report then only specify the deviations from the corporate design.
You configure the global settings for reports via [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > Reporting.#

.Settings such as templates and font sizes can be set globally
image::reporting_global_settings.png[alt="Global settings for reports."]

[#new_template]
=== Create your own report template
{CMK} provides a pre-built, clear report template that you can add to and use as you wish, as described above. However, especially reports that are passed on to management look even better if they correspond to your own company layout. For this purpose, there is an option to create your own report template.

By default, the [.guihint]#Default template for all reports# is used for all reports in {CMK}:

image::reporting_list_selection2.png[alt="Selection from list of reports."]

To create your own report template, copy the default template using icon:icon_clone[alt="icon to copy"]. First, change [.guihint]#Unique ID# and [.guihint]#Title#.

To mark this report template as such, check [.guihint]#Report Properties# in the box [.guihint]#This is a front matter Template#:

image::reporting_report_properties4.png[alt="Specify as a report template."]

From the first save, you will then find this template in the custom report templates:

image::reporting_customized3.png[alt="Selection of report template in the 'Customized' box."]

Now you can customize this template according to the above descriptions just like any other report. Change the page layout, font, line colors, etc. Also set the content elements at the same time. Exclusively for report templates there is also the report element [.guihint]#Table of Contents#:

image::reporting_step1_content.png[alt="Table of Contents Selection."]

To create one of your reports now with the new template, change the settings in the report's [.guihint]#Report Properties# one more time. Set the [.guihint]#Use settings and page layout from# option to the name of your new template:

image::reporting_report_properties3.png[alt="Change report template."]

Your report will always be created with this template in the future from the time you save it.
