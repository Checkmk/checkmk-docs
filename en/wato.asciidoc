:description: {CMK} enables the entire basic configuration directly in the web interface. This article offers a first introduction to the configuration environment.

[#setup_menu]
== Setup-Menü

Your entry point to the configuration of {CMK} is the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, which you can open via the navigation bar:

image::wato_setup_menu_showmore.png[alt="Setup menu in the navigation bar."]

In this menu you will find the tools with which you can set up and configure {CMK}. 
The menu is divided into _topics_. 
Below each topic you will find the menu items. 

The following table gives an overview of the menus and in which part of the User guide you will find more detailed information.


[cols="25,~", options="header"]
|===
|Menu |Content 
|[.guihint]#Hosts# |The xref:wato_hosts#[administration of hosts] to be monitored. Here you will find the hosts, the host monitoring
xref:wato_rules#[rules], the 
xref:wato_rules#hosttags[host tag groups], the connections for the  
xref:dcd#[dynamic host configuration], the
xref:wato_hosts#host_groups[host groups] and the rules for the
xref:inventory#[hardware/software inventory].
With the [.guihint]#Custom host attributes# you can create attributes yourself that are added to the properties of the hosts.

|[.guihint]#Services# |The xref:wato_services#[configuration of services] running on the hosts. Here you will find the  
xref:wato_rules#[rules] for service monitoring, for service discovery, for enforced services 
(xref:wato_services#manual_checks[manual checks]) and for monitoring network services like HTTP, TCP, email 
(xref:active_checks#[active checks]). In addition, you can open the list of 
xref:wato_services#service_groups[service groups] and the link:https://checkmk.com/integrations[catalog of check plug-ins] in {CMK}.

|[.guihint]#Business Intelligence# |Getting started with the management of xref:bi#[Business Intelligence (BI)].

|[.guihint]#Agents# |The xref:wato_monitoringagents#[monitoring agents] that transmit the data from the hosts.
Here there are the
xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agents] for Linux, Windows and other operating systems for download and in the {CEE} access to the 
xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery], which can be used to configure, package and automatically update agents.
You can also find rules for monitoring other systems -- e.g. via 
xref:snmp#[SNMP].
The entry [.guihint]#VM, Cloud, Container# leads you, among other things, to the rules for
xref:monitoring_aws#[Amazon Web Services (AWS)],
xref:monitoring_azure#[Microsoft Azure],
xref:monitoring_kubernetes#[Kubernetes],
xref:monitoring_prometheus#[Prometheus], and
xref:monitoring_vmware#[VMWare ESXi].

|[.guihint]#Events# |The processing of events -- with rules for
xref:notifications#[notifications],
xref:ec#[Event Console] and
xref:alert_handlers#[alert handler].

|[.guihint]#Users# |The topics around 
xref:wato_user#[users, roles and permissions]. You can call up the lists of users, contact groups and roles and setup the
xref:ldap#[user management with LDAP/Active Directory].

|[.guihint]#General# |Comprehensive topics can be found here, including [.guihint]#Rule search# for finding rules (again), the [.guihint]#Global settings#, the list of 
xref:timeperiods# [time periods] and the entry to 
xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring]. 
With [.guihint]#Audit log# you can display all changes ever made to the configuration environment and with [.guihint]#Read only mode# temporarily prevent such changes.

|[.guihint]#Maintenance# |This topic summarises actions to maintain {CMK}, such as making
xref:backup#[backups], the handling of
xref:mkps#[{CMK} extension packages (MKPs)] or the creation of 
xref:support_diagnostics#[support diagnostics] data.
|===

The configuration is stored by {CMK} in a conventional
text data format which experienced users can edit manually, or even create with scripts.


[#quick_setup]
== Quick setup

Once you have worked longer with the [.guihint]#Setup# menu you will have learned its icons off by heart -- especially if you have the icons in the mega menus displayed for each menu item, as you can set in the xref:user_interface#user_menu[User menu].

Then, for quick access, we recommend the [.guihint]#Quick setup# snapin for the xref:user_interface#sidebar[sidebar] with icons for each [.guihint]#Setup# menu item:

image::wato_quick_setup.png[alt="Snapin Quick setup.",width=50%]

By the way, there is also the complete [.guihint]#Setup# menu for the sidebar. This snapin is called [.guihint]#Setup#.


[#activate_changes]
== Activate changes

{CMK} initially saves all changes you make only in a temporary *configuration environment*, in which you manage hosts, services and settings, and which does not yet affect the currently running monitoring. Only by "activating the accumulated changes" are they transferred to the *monitoring environment*.

Changes in the configuration -- e.g. the addition of a new host -- therefore initially have no influence on the monitoring.
Only through activation do all changes that have accumulated since the last activation become active as a ‘bundle’ at the same time. 

This might seem a little cumbersome, but it does have the advantage that more complex changes can be prepared without haste in advance before being put into production.
For example, after adding a new host you might want to define thresholds or remove some services before ‘arming’ the whole thing.

Whenever you make a change to the monitoring configuration using the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, this change will at first be picked up and held as _pending_.

You will find information on the top right of each page of the configuration environment about how many changes have accumulated so far that are not yet activated, e.g. the button icon:button_3_changes[alt="Icon for displaying 3 pending changes."]. This button will take you to a list of these changes:

image::wato_pending_log.png[alt="List of pending changes for activation."]

Clicking [.guihint]#Activate on selected sites# will create a new configuration for the monitoring core from the configuration files and instruct the core to immediately begin using the new configuration:

image::wato_activate_changes.png[alt="Illustration of the change activation from the configuration environment to the monitoring environment.",width=400px]

This clears the list of pending changes.
These entries are not lost however -- they can subsequently be called up via [.guihint]#Setup > General > Audit log#.
There you will find the contents of the log file with all activated changes that have ever been made in the site.
The [.guihint]#Audit log# can be filtered and shows today's changes by default.
