:description: {CMK} enables the entire basic configuration directly in the web interface. This article offers a first introduction to the configuration environment.

[#setup_menu]
== Setup menu

Your entry point to the configuration of {CMK} is the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, which you can open via the navigation bar:

.The [.guihint]#Setup# menu of the {CE} in Show more mode
image::wato_setup_menu_showmore.png[alt="Setup menu in the navigation bar."]

In this menu you will find the tools with which you can set up and configure {CMK}.
The menu is divided into _topics_.
Below each topic you will find the menu items.

The following table gives an overview of the menus and in which part of the User Guide you will find more detailed information.

[cols="25,~", options="header"]
|===
|Menu |Content
|[.guihint]#Hosts# |The
xref:hosts_setup#[administration of hosts] to be monitored. Here you will find the hosts, the host monitoring
xref:wato_rules#[rules], the
xref:host_tags#[host tags], the connections for the
xref:dcd#[dynamic host management], the
xref:hosts_structure#host_groups[host groups] and the rules for the
xref:inventory#[HW/SW inventory].
With [.guihint]#Custom host attributes#, you can create your own attributes that can be added to the properties of the hosts.

|[.guihint]#Services# |The
xref:wato_services#[configuration of services] running on the hosts. Here you will find the
xref:wato_rules#[rules] for service monitoring, for 
xref:wato_services#discovery[service discovery], for 
xref:wato_services#enforced_services[enforced services], and for monitoring network services like HTTP, TCP, email
(xref:active_checks#[active checks]). In addition, you can open the list of
xref:wato_services#service_groups[service groups] and the 
link:https://checkmk.com/integrations[catalog of check plug-ins^] in {CMK}.

|[.guihint]#Business Intelligence# |Getting started with the management of xref:bi#[Business Intelligence (BI)].

|[.guihint]#Agents# |The 
xref:wato_monitoringagents#[monitoring agents] that transmit the data from the hosts.
Here there are the
xref:wato_monitoringagents#agents[{CMK} agents] for Linux, Windows and other operating systems available for download, access to the
xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery] (only in the commercial editions), which can be used to configure, package and automatically update agents,
and agent registration to 
xref:hosts_autoregister#[automatically create hosts] (only in the {CE}).
You can also find rules for monitoring other systems -- e.g. via
xref:snmp#[SNMP].
The [.guihint]#VM, Cloud, Container# entry leads you, among other things, to the rules for monitoring
xref:monitoring_aws#[Amazon Web Services (AWS)],
xref:monitoring_azure#[Microsoft Azure],
xref:monitoring_gcp#[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)],
xref:monitoring_kubernetes#[Kubernetes],
xref:monitoring_prometheus#[Prometheus], and
xref:monitoring_vmware#[VMware ESXi].

|[.guihint]#Events# |The processing of events -- with rules for
xref:notifications#[notifications],
xref:ec#[Event Console] and
xref:alert_handlers#[alert handler] (only in the commercial editions).

|[.guihint]#Users# |The topics relating to
xref:wato_user#[users, roles and permissions]. You can call up the lists of users, contact groups and roles, set up the
xref:ldap#[user management with LDAP/Active Directory] and configure authentication with
xref:saml#[SAML] (only in the commercial editions).

|[.guihint]#General# |Comprehensive topics can be found here, including [.guihint]#Rule search# for finding rules (again), the [.guihint]#Global settings#, the
xref:wato_rules#conditions[predefined conditions], the
xref:timeperiods#[time periods], the password store and the entry to
xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring].
With [.guihint]#Audit log# you can display all changes ever made to the configuration environment and with [.guihint]#Read only mode# temporarily prevent such changes.

|[.guihint]#Maintenance# |This topic summarizes actions to maintain {CMK}, such as creating
xref:backup#[backups], 
xref:analyze_configuration#[analyzing the {CMK} configuration] or selecting data for
xref:support_diagnostics#[support diagnostics].
The entries for 
xref:license#[licensing] and handling of
xref:mkps#[{CMK} extension packages (MKPs)] are only available in the commercial editions.

|[.guihint]#Exporter# |The export of data, i.e. metrics to 
xref:metrics_exporter#[InfluxDB (and Graphite)].
This topic is only available in the commercial editions.
|===

The configuration is stored by {CMK} in a conventional text data format which experienced users can edit manually, or even create using scripts.


[#quick_setup]
== Quick setup

Once you have more experience in working with the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, you will have learned its icons by heart
-- especially if you have the icons in the mega menus displayed for each menu item,
as you can set in the xref:user_interface#user_menu[User menu].

Then, for quick access, we recommend the [.guihint]#Quick setup# snap-in for the xref:user_interface#sidebar[sidebar] with its icons for each [.guihint]#Setup# menu
item:

[#activate_changes]
== Activating changes

{CMK} initially saves all changes you make only in a temporary *configuration environment*, in which you manage hosts, services and settings,
and which does not yet affect the currently-running monitoring.
Only by 'activating the pending changes' will these be transferred to the _production_ *monitoring environment*.

Changes in the configuration -- e.g. the addition of a new host -- therefore initially have no influence on the monitoring.
Only through activation do all changes that have accumulated since the last activation become active as a ‘bundle’ at the same time.

This might seem a little cumbersome,
but it does have the advantage that more complex changes can be prepared without haste in advance before being put into production.
For example, after adding a new host, you might want to define thresholds or remove some services before ‘arming’ the whole thing.

Whenever you make a change to the monitoring configuration using the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, this change will at first be picked up and held as _pending_.

You will find a yellow button on the top right of each configuration environment page with the number of pending changes that are not yet activated.
This button will open a list of these pending changes:

image::wato_pending_log.png[alt="List of pending changes for activation."]

Clicking [.guihint]#Activate on selected sites# will create a new configuration for the monitoring core from the configuration files
and instruct the core to immediately begin using the new configuration:

image::wato_activate_changes.png[alt="Illustration of the change activation from the configuration environment to the monitoring environment.",width=500px]

This clears the list of pending changes.
These entries are not lost however -- they can subsequently be called up via [.guihint]#Setup > General > Audit log#.
There you will find the contents of the log file with all activated changes that have ever been made in the site.
The [.guihint]#Audit log# can be filtered and shows today's changes by default.

[#revert_changes]
== Revert changes

You will encounter the activation of changes again and again when setting up your monitoring system, as well as every time you adjust the configuration later on.
Especially if you make more complex modifications to your system, you may want to revert changes during the editing process instead of activating them.
Use the menu item [.guihint]#Changes > Revert changes# for this purpose.

This allows you to discard all pending changes since the last [.guihint]#Activate on selected sites#:

image::intro_setup_monitor_revert.png[alt="Confirm revert."]

All changes that will be reverted if you confirm the confirmation prompt are displayed in the lower area.
This takes you back to the status of the last change activation.
