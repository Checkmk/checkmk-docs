== Installation of {CMK} on a Linux server

You’re already familiar with the Linux command line? You have a -- virtual or physical --
Linux server and you have root access? Then you
can install {CMK} with little effort. We provide precompiled installation packages
for most modern Linux server distributions, including *Debian*, *Ubuntu*, *RHEL*,
*CentOS * oder *SLES*. The procedure is as follows:

=== Select and download a package

On the {CMK} link:https://checkmk.com/download.php?[download pages] you can choose from:

* {CRE} -- a free and 100% open-source version
* {CFE} -- free, unlimited for 30 days, then limited to one site with up to 25 hosts
* {CSE} -- requires a subscription
* {CME} -- also requires a subscription

Select the desired release. You will be directed to the package download page. When choosing
the appropriate package, please be careful to select the correct version for your operating
system and architecture (32 or 64 bit). Download the package and copy it to your Linux server,
e.g. to `/tmp`.


=== Package installation

Install the package *including its dependencies*. For this, use `apt install`
(Debian, Ubuntu), `zypper install` (SLES), or `yum install` (RedHat, CentOS).
First ensure that packages from the net can later be installed. With SLES, SDK must be
integrated as the package source, with RHEL the EPEL repository. Software from other sources
is not required.

Advice for integrating the package sources and the installation of Linux systems can be
found in our xref:install_packages#[Comprehensive Installation Instructions].

=== Creating and starting monitoring instances

Create a monitoring instance (site) as root with a name of your choice, e.g. `mysite`
and start the instance.

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd create mysite
{c-root} omd start mysite
----

[#login]
=== Log in to the web interface (GUI)

Your system is now ready. The login to the web interface is performed via the browser at
`http://HOSTNAME/mysite/`.  Log in as user `cmkadmin`, and following the site’s creation, the randomly-generated password
for it will be found in the output:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd create mysite
Adding /opt/omd/sites/mysite/tmp to /etc/fstab.
Creating temporary filesystem /omd/sites/mysite/tmp...OK
Restarting Apache...OK
Created new site mysite with version 1.4.0.cee.

  The site can be started with omd start mysite.
  The default web UI is available at http://Klappsandwich/mysite/
  The admin user for the web applications is cmkadmin with password V0U26y6a
  (It can be changed with 'htpasswd -m ~/etc/htpasswd cmkadmin' as site user.)
  Please do a su - mysite for administration of this site.
----

With this data you can now log in to your site:

Your {CMK} system is now ready for use. For a brief tutorial on how to configure {CMK}
and start monitoring, please read our
xref:checkmk_getting_started#[Introduction to monitoring with {CMK} guide].

== Upgrading from the {FE} to the full version

The {FE} can be easily upgraded to the full version at any time by link:https://checkmk.com/subscription.php?[purchasing a subscription].
Install an additional and suitable {SE} or {ME} package. This will appear as a
new version, which then via a version upgrade can be defined as the target version.
The exact procedure for the upgrade is comprehensively described in its xref:update#[own article].
In the same article you will also find a xref:update#updatedemo[section] detailing an upgrade from the {FE} to the full version.
