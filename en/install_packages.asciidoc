:title: Basic information on the installation of {CMK}
:description: Each Linux distribution (RHEL/CentOS, SLES, Debian and Ubuntu) has its own special features which need to be considered when installing {CMK}.

==  Why Linux?

{CMK} is a comprehensive software package, which basically requires _Linux_
as its operating system. Why? Linux is an excellent platform for the operation
of {CMK}, because it is very performant and stable, and many important tools are
already integrated. Alongside this there is the pleasant side benefit of the
availability of completely-free distributions of Linux with Debian, Ubuntu and
CentOS, which are enterprise-capable and supported by {CMK}.

If you do not want to deal with Linux under any circumstances, it is also
possible to run {CMK} as xref:introduction_virt1#[a virtual appliance],
link:https://checkmk.com/appliance.html#physical_appliance[a physical appliance], or as
xref:introduction_docker#[a Docker-Container].

== Supported Distributions

Linux is a free system and offered by many producers in their own variants
(distributions).  This is of course very positive, because competition
stimulates business, increases quality, and as a user you always have the
possibility to switch to a Linux distribution that is better-suited to your
needs.

However, this diversity also has a disadvantage: The available distributions
differ in many details, among other things also in the versions of the provided
software libraries, directory paths, pre-configuration, etc.

// MFS START-PROOFREAD
To make sure that everything runs smoothly with {CMK}, we decided from the very beginning to develop a separate installation package of {CMK} for every
important Linux distribution:

// -- and even for every single version of these
// distributions, as long as it is still being maintained by the developer. More
// work for us -- less stress for you!


* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) und binrkompatible Derivate (wie CentOS) ab Version 7.x
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Version 12 ab SP3 oder Version 15
* Debian ab Version 9.0
* Ubuntu in den Versionen 16.04, 18.04 und 20.04

We currently support the following Linux distributions:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and binary compatible derivates (like CentOS) from Version 7.x
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 from SP3 or Version 15
* Debian from Version 9.0
* Ubuntu Version 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04

// REMOVE-AFTER-BETA
// MFS: Lehne ich mich da zu weit aus dem Fenster?
Generally we support any of the mentioned Linux distributions that was in active security maintenance at release time of a certain version of {CMK}.
This means there might be packages provided for distributions that are ot of support or in extended support (with costs).
As a far-sighted approach we thus recommend chosing a recent LTS (long term support) distribution at least upon fresh install of a dedicated {CMK} server. 
// MFS END-PROOFREAD

For the installation of {CMK} you need a physical or virtual server on which you have already installed Linux.
The installation is then achieved in four steps:

. Preparing the Linux-System
. Setting-up the package sources
. Downloading of the appropriate {CMK} package
. Installation of the {CMK} package


== Preparation of the Linux system

Depending on which distribution you are installing, different steps are
necessary for the preparation. For this reason we will assume that the Linux
system on which the {CMK} is to be installed has been installed with the
developer’s default settings, and correctly-connected to the network, so that it
is accessible via HTTP and SSH from your workplace.


=== Partitioning hard drive space

{CMK} stores its data under the `/opt/omd` physical path. If the system
is to be used exclusively for {CMK}, the major part of the hard drive’s free
space should be available. In this case it is not essential -- but very
desirable -- that `/opt/omd`, or `/opt` has its own partition.


[#smtpconfig]
=== SMTP for outgoing emails

If you wish to send monitoring notifications by email, then for outgoing emails
a correct configuration of the SMTP service is required. Usually you define a
smarthost to which all emails are to be redirected.


=== Settings for the system time

In order for the monitoring server to have a correct system time, we strongly
recommend setting up NTP. The hardware clock should be set to UTC. As soon as
the server is taken into monitoring with {CMK}, NTP will ensure the correct time
is used for all functions.

[#distribution_instructions]
== Installation instructions

Depending on the Linux distribution you want to install {CMK} onto, please
follow one of the dedicated installation instruction below:

* xref:install_packages_debian#[Debian and Ubuntu]
* xref:install_packages_redhat#[Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS]
* xref:install_packages_sles#[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]
