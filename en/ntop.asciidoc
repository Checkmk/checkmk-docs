:title: Integrating ntopng in {CMK} - Connect {CMK} to an ntop solution
:description: With the integration of ntopng, you extend the functions of {CMK} with the monitoring of the network data flows and the deep analysis of the network traffic.


== Introduction

[{image-left}]
image::ntop_ntopng_logo.png[width=150]

{CMK} provides many basic functions for monitoring your network infrastructure and delivers the associated metrics -- such as bandwidth, packet rate or error rate.
It also allows the monitoring of the state and speed of network interfaces and thresholds.

So far, so good. But what about the following questions -- Who is communicating with your hosts? Which ports of your hosts are used? Who talks most often, i.e. who are the so-called 'top talkers'? Which applications are used in the network? Is my network performing well and where are the bottlenecks, if any? Are there threats, for instance from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks?

To get answers to such and similar questions, a deep analysis of your network is necessary -- which {CMK} alone cannot do. Here an analysis of the network flows is needed, i.e. the many communication relationships that take place simultaneously in the network. A network flow is defined by source and by destination (each determined by the IP address and port) and the protocol used.

Instead of adding the functions for in-depth network monitoring to {CMK} and thus reinventing the wheel, there is a more elegant solution -- the integration of *ntopng* into {CMK}.


ntopng is the powerful and resource-efficient software for monitoring and analysing network traffic in real time as well as data from the past -- so that it can provide the answers to the questions posed above. ntopng is the core of the open-source network traffic monitoring solution from the company link:https://www.ntop.org/[ntop]. In an ntop solution, data is usually collected from the devices via special software modules (*nProbe*) and forwarded to ntopng for analysis.

ntopng is related to {CMK} in more ways than one -- it comes from and is rooted in the open source world. ntopng is available in a freely-available ('Community') and in several extended ('Professional' and 'Enterprise') link:https://www.ntop.org/guides/ntopng/what_is_ntopng.html#versions[versions]. The user interface is web-based and offers the information in views and dashboards. Multiple users can be created and each user can be assigned a role. Alerting based on thresholds is supported. Lastly, the data can be fetched from ntopng via REST API.

The interaction of the products involved is shown in the following illustration:

[{image-border}]

The integration of ntopng thus extends the functional scope of {CMK} by two important points -- the monitoring of the network data flow, and the in-depth analysis of the network traffic.

In this context, integration means the following in concrete terms:

. {CMK} and ntopng are installed and configured as independent systems on different servers. It is recommended that {CMK} and ntopng *not* be run on the same server.

. A connection is established from the {CMK} server to the ntopng server. ({CMK} communicates with ntopng via its REST API.) The connection parameters are used to decide which data is fetched from ntopng. The assignment is made via the available user accounts of both systems.

. Information from ntopng is displayed in the {CMK} user interface. This happens on the one hand in new views and dashboards in which the ntopng information is prepared for {CMK} users. On the other hand, ntopng data can be integrated into existing {CMK} views and dashboards.


[#ntop_connect]
== Connecting to ntopng

{cee-only}
To use the integration of ntopng in {CMK}, you need an ntopng in a Professional or Enterprise version >= 4.2, as the ntopng REST API V1 that {CMK} and ntopng use to communicate is only supported from version 4.2 onwards.

First collect the following information about the ntopng target system you want to connect to {CMK}. You must enter this information into {CMK} as ntopng connection parameters:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|Host name |The name or IP address ([.guihint]#Host Address#) of the ntopng server
|Port number |The number of the TCP port ([.guihint]#Port number#), over which ntopng can be reached. The port is specified when ntopng is started. The default is `3000`.
|Protocol |`HTTP` or `HTTPS`. The connection between {CMK} and ntopng should only be made via HTTPS. The name and password of the ntopng user account are stored in plain text in the {CMK} site, as the access data must be transmitted unencrypted via the REST API to the ntopng server.
|User account for authentication|Name and password of a user account of the ntopng user group Administrator ([.guihint]#ntopng Admin User#). Checkmk authenticates with the ntopng server using these credentials via the REST API. By the way, the default user account of ntopng is called `admin` and is assigned to the user group Administrator. 
|===

In {CMK}, start entering the ntopng connection parameters in the [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > Ntopng (chargeable add-on) > Ntopng Connection Parameters (chargeable add-on)# menu:

image::ntop_connection.png[]

You will have obtained most of the requested parameter values by now and can therefore take them from the table above. We only need to take a closer look at one of the connection parameters: [.guihint]#ntopng username to aquire data for#. This determines who can see which ntopng data in {CMK}. 
The user accounts with which {CMK} authorises itself with ntopng and with which {CMK} fetches data from ntopng are defined differently.
We explain the choices and the resulting differences in fetching the data in the following two chapters.

*Note:* The entries for the connection to ntopng are not checked for validity when saving. You will not receive error messages about invalid values until xref:ntop#ntop_info_show[the display of ntopng information]. With the first ntopng connection parameter [.guihint]#Enable this ntopng instance# you can deactivate the connection to ntopng, for instance if the ntopng server is temporarily unavailable.


[#ntop_user_fixed]
=== Fixed assignments of {CMK} and ntopng users with the same name

The simplest solution is to give a {CMK} user access to the information he sees in ntopng under the same user name.

To do this, select the value [.guihint]#Use the {CMK} username as ntopng user name# for the parameter [.guihint]#ntopng username to aquire data for#. {CMK} will then use the current {CMK} username and retrieve the data from ntopng under that name.

For data retrieval to work via this assignment, at least one user account with the same name must exist in both {CMK} and ntopng. No matter how you think about it, it will probably be necessary to change the users in {CMK}, ntopng or even in both systems. How to create or change a user in {CMK} is explained in the article on xref:wato_user#[user administration].

After you have xref:wato#activate_changes[activated the changes], all {CMK} users will see the user interface changes for ntopng as described in the xref:ntop#ntop_info_show[chapter on displaying the ntopng information], for example the extension of the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu. However the ntopng data will only be visible to those {CMK} users who have a user account on the ntopng counterpart. The other {CMK} users will be able to open the ntopng-specific pages, but will only receive blank pages or an error message that the login data is invalid.

This is the simplest option, but also an inflexible one.


[#ntop_user_flex]
=== Flexible assignment of {CMK} users to ntopng users

{CMK} and ntopng have similar concepts in their user administration -- both systems can have multiple users, and each user is assigned a role. In {CMK} these roles are called `Administrator`, `Normal monitoring user` and `Guest user`, while ntopng has the `Administrator` and `Non Privileged User` roles. These assigned roles are used -- among other functions -- to decide which information a user can access.

Instead of the rigid 1:1 assignment described above, you have the option of deciding for each {CMK} user whether you want to give them ntopng data and -- if so -- from which ntopng user they should receive it.

Since the users are assigned different roles in both systems, you can control very precisely who is allowed to see what of ntopng in {CMK}, for example like this: You do not assign an ntopng user to a {CMK} `Guest user` who is not interested in network traffic, so the ntopng-specific extensions of the {CMK} interface are hidden for this user. Assign an ntopng `Non Privileged User` to a {CMK} `Normal monitoring user` and a network trainee. Assign an ntopng `Administrator` to a {CMK} `Administrator` and network expert.

The procedure for flexible allocations is as follows:

In the [.guihint]#Ntopng Connection Parameters (chargeable add-on)# select the value [.guihint]#Use the ntopng username as configured in the User settings# for the [.guihint]#ntopng user name to aquire data for#.

After you have saved the ntopng connection settings, a new field will appear in the settings of each user ([.guihint]#Setup > Users > Users#) under [.guihint]#Identiy#, e.g. as shown below for the user `cmkadmin`:

image::ntop_user_settings.png[]

In the [.guihint]#ntopng Username# field, enter the ntopng user name whose information is to be displayed to the current {CMK} user. If this field is left empty (which is the default), the ntopng-specific extensions of the {CMK} interface are hidden for the {CMK} user. Finally, activate the changes.

[#ntop_info_show]
== Displaying the ntopng information

Once the requirements described in the chapter xref:ntop#ntop_connect[connecting to ntopng] have been met, you will now have access to the ntopng data in {CMK}. To do this, log in to {CMK} under a user account that is assigned to an ntopng user account.

The following is an overview of where and how you can access the ntopng information in the {CMK} user interface.

[#ntop_monitor_menu]
=== Network statistics in the Monitor menu

image::ntop_menu_monitor.png[]

The most noticeable change can be found in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, which contains the new [.guihint]#Network statistics# topic with entries for a view and several dashboards with ntopng data, which we will introduce in the next chapters.


[#ntop_hosts_view]
=== The Ntop Hosts view

{CMK} and ntopng manage not only their users but also their hosts independently. However, if a host in {CMK} is also set up in ntopng, it will be displayed in the [.guihint]#Ntop Hosts# view, which thus shows the intersection of {CMK} and ntopng hosts.

Select [.guihint]#Monitor > Network statistics > Ntop Hosts#:

image::ntop_hosts_action_menu.png[]

The [.guihint]#Ntop Hosts# view provides a quick overview of all hosts that are set up in both systems.
In the example above, there are two common hosts. One ntopng host shows the entry [.guihint]#Ntopng integration of this host# in the action menu. By the way, this entry is not only available in this but also in all other host views in the monitoring, for instance in the [.guihint]#All hosts# view. 


[#ntop_nw_statistics]
=== Network statistics for a host

For an ntopng host, click the action menu item [.guihint]#Ntopng integration of this host# and you will get the host-specific page [.guihint]#Network statistics and flows#:

image::ntop_nw_statistics.png[]

On this page, the network data from the selected host is presented from different perspectives under the following tabs:

* [.guihint]#Host#: Basic information for the host and a summary of the most important information from the other tabs

* [.guihint]#Traffic#: Information on the layer 4 protocol (TCP and UDP) for an overview as a pie chart and detailed as a table

* [.guihint]#Packets#: Distribution of flags in TCP connections. Flags indicate a certain state of the connection or provide additional information. The most frequently used flags are SYN (synchronisation), ACK (acknowledgement), FIN (finish) and RST (reset).

* [.guihint]#Ports#: Traffic statistics grouped by client and server ports

* [.guihint]#Peers#: An overview of the most frequently contacted _peers_ (meaning partners) and the most frequently used applications -- as graphics and a table. The graphic elements can be filtered by clicking on them.

* [.guihint]#Apps#: Amount of traffic divided by applications and summarised categories. The layer 7 applications are determined by a deep packet inspection. In the application table, the application names are linked and lead to an ntopng page with detailed information.

* [.guihint]#Flows#: Table of the data flows that have the selected host as a start or end point. For more information, see the chapter xref:ntop#ntop_flows_dashboard[Flows Dashboard].

* [.guihint]#Engaged Alerts#, [.guihint]#Past Alerts#, [.guihint]#Flow Alerts#: tables of active alerts, past alerts and flow alerts. For more information, see the chapter xref:ntop#ntop_alerts_dashboard[Alerts Dashboard].

In each tab, you can use the [.guihint]#View data in ntopng# link to access the associated ntopng page, which will take you to the ntopng link:https://www.ntop.org/guides/ntopng/web_gui/host_details.html[Host Details].


*Tipp:* You can also access the [.guihint]#Network statistics and flows# page from the [.guihint]#Services of Host# and [.guihint]#Status of Host# views by selecting the tab that opens the page. Both views, when called for an ntopng host, provide the [.guihint]#ntop# menu in their menu bar, which contains entries for each individual tab.


[#ntop_host_status]
=== Status of a host

On the [.guihint]#Network statistics and flows# page, click [.guihint]#Status of host# in the action bar to open the [.guihint]#Status of Host# view.

In this view a wide variety of host-specific information is displayed in a table, which can be extended by ntopng-specific entries. This will show information that you are already familiar with from some of the tabs on the [.guihint]#Network statistics and flows# page -- partly due to lack of space, however, only a selection of this information will be displayed.

To use the ntopng-specific entries, you must xref:views#edit[Customise the view]. In the menu, select [.guihint]#Display > Customize view#. On the [.guihint]#Clone view# page, the columns of the table contents can be defined.

You can add the following ntopng-specific entries:

* [.guihint]#Hosts: Ntop hosts details#: Shows the most important information under the [.guihint]#Host# tab.

* [.guihint]#Hosts: Ntop protocol breakdown#: Shows the log table in the [.guihint]#Traffic# tab.

* [.guihint]#Hosts: Ntop ports#: Shows the client and server pie charts of the [.guihint]#Ports# tab.

* [.guihint]#Hosts: Ntop top peers#: Shows the application pie chart of the [.guihint]#Peers# tab.


[#ntop_alerts_dashboard]
=== The Alerts dashboard

The [.guihint]#Alerts# dashboard gives you an overview of all alerts in ntopng.

Select [.guihint]#Monitor > Network statistics > Alerts#:

image::ntop_dashboard_alerts.png[]

The first line shows a summary of all hosts set up in ntopng, with the number of current alerts ([.guihint]#Alerts# and [.guihint]#Flow Alerts#).

You can switch between the alert tables with the following tabs:

* [.guihint]#Engaged#: Table of active alerts (_engaged alerts_). ntopng generates alerts to report the exceeding of thresholds.

* [.guihint]#Past#: Table of old alerts that are no longer active (_past alerts_).

* [.guihint]#Flows#: Table of flow alerts, a special category in which ntopng reports abnormal or suspicious flows. Flow alerts are always linked to events. They are collected in their own category and do not appear in the tables of active or past alerts.

In all tabs, there are two bar charts above the table with a breakdown by date and time, which you can use to filter the table: By dragging with the mouse, select a time interval in one diagram -- or successively in both. The filter defined in this way is immediately applied to the alert table. To switch off the filter, click outside the marking in the diagram.

*Note:* This dashboard is similar in structure to the three alert-specific tabs on the [.guihint]#Network statistics and flows# page (see the chapter xref:ntop#ntop_nw_statistics[Network statistics for a host]).


[#ntop_flows_dashboard]
=== The Flows dashboard

The [.guihint]#Flows# dashboard gives you an overview of the data flows in ntopng. A data flow is a connection via the Layer 4 Protocol between the starting point and the end point, each determined by IP address and port. A data flow can only be displayed after the data transmission has been completed. For this reason the display of data flows is always a look into the past -- even if it was only a few seconds ago.

Select [.guihint]#Monitor > Network statistics > Flows#:

image::ntop_dashboard_flows.png[]

The first line, as with the [.guihint]#Alerts# dashboard, shows a summary for all of the hosts set up in ntopng.

The table is essentially identical to the link:https://www.ntop.org/guides/ntopng/web_gui/flows.html[Flows] table in the ntopng interface.

*Note:* This dashboard is similar in structure to the [.guihint]#Flows# tab on the [.guihint]#Network statistics and flows# page (see the chapter xref:ntop#ntop_nw_statistics[Network statistics for a host]).


[#ntop_toptalkers_dashboard]
=== The Top Talkers dashboard

The [.guihint]#Top Talkers# dashboard shows you in real time which hosts in ntopng are generating the most network traffic.

Select [.guihint]#Monitor > Network statistics > Top Talkers#:

image::ntop_dashboard_toptalkers.png[]

In the left part of the dashboard, the current 'Top Talkers' are listed, sorted by the volume of the data traffic they are exchanging. The upper section shows the hosts in the local network, the lower section the destinations in remote networks.

In the diagrams you also get an overview of the data traffic in the applications (left) and the monitored interfaces (right), during the last hour (top) and for the preceeding 24 hours (bottom). The entries in the legend displayed in each diagram are clickable and can be used to filter the data.

*Note:* This dashboard is similar in structure to the link:https://www.ntop.org/guides/ntopng/web_gui/dashboard.html#dashboard-in-the-professional-version[Traffic Dashboard] in the ntopng interface.


[#ntop_dashlets]
=== Dashlets

The [.guihint]#Alerts#, [.guihint]#Flows# and [.guihint]#Top Talkers# dashboards presented in the last chapters all consist of only one dashlet each.

When xref:dashboards#[editing a dashboard], you can use these ntopng dashlets to customise existing dashboards or to create new ones. You can get started with the dashboard configuration in the [.guihint]#Dashboards > Customize Dashboards# menu. When editing a dashboard, you will find the ntopng dashlets, as well as the other dashlets, in the [.guihint]#Add# menu.
