== Mode of operation

IT-operations distinguish between two types of outage: planned and unplanned.
The monitoring system intially cannot know if a detected outage was planned
or not.  With the concept of _scheduled downtimes_ the system can be
informed of a host’s or service’s planned outages by defining a scheduled
downtime for the corresponding object.
If a host or service is in such a maintenance period, it has the following effects:

* In the views, an icon appears next to the affected hosts and services: Services are marked with a icon:icon_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for services."] guiding cone, hosts with a icon:icon_derived_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for hosts."] blue pause icon. Services whose hosts are in downtime also get the blue pause icon. In the xref:history[history], started downtimes are marked with icon:icon_alert_downtime[alt="Icon for indicating a started scheduled downtime."] and finished downtimes with icon:icon_alert_downtimestop[alt="Icon for indicating a finished scheduled downtime."].
* Problem notifications are deactivated during the downtime.
* The affected hosts/services are not identified as having a problem in the [.guihint]#Overview#.
* Scheduled downtimes are specially taken into account in the xref:availability#[availability analysis].
* For information a special notification will be triggered at the start and end of a scheduled downtime.


== Entering scheduled downtimes

Defining scheduled downtimes is achieved via xref:commands#[commands]. All actions
pertaining to scheduled downtimes are available here in a single menu:

image::basics_downtimes_schedule.png[]

The [.guihint]#Downtime Comment# field must always be filled out. You can include a URL, such as
_\http://www.example.com_ in this field, which will be replaced by a clickable link.
There are multiple
ways to define start and end time ranges. From the simple [.guihint]#2 hours#,
which defines the downtime as starting *from now*, to the entry of an
explicit time range where a future maintenance can also be defined.


=== Flexible with max. duration

This option is useful when, e.g., you know that a host will enter a {DOWN} state
for a few minutes, but the exact time of the event cannot be predicted. With
this option the scheduled downtime does not begin automatically at a nominated
time, rather first when a real Problem status appears for the host.

Example: You define a scheduled downtime as being from 14:00 to 16:00, and
activate the [.guihint]#flexible# option with a duration of 30 minutes. At 14:00 the
scheduled downtime will not activate, but rather is in a standby position. As
soon as the host enters a {DOWN} or {UNREACH} state,
the scheduled downtime (30 min) will begin and the ‘blue moon’ will appear.
This will remain so for the duration of the time nominated in the option,
regardless of the actual status of the host, and if need be beyond the end-time
specified for the downtime.

Therefore with flexible scheduled downtimes the start/end time is only the
time window in which the scheduled downtime can begin. If no problem status
occurs within this time window the scheduled downtime will simply be
skipped. These conditions of course also apply for services.


=== Also set downtime on child hosts

This option is useful for routers and switches, and also e.g., for
virtualisation hosts.  In this way {CMK} will also automatically
set a scheduled downtime on all directly-connected hosts, and also on
indirectly-connected hosts if the [.guihint]#Do this recursively# box is selected.


=== Repeat this downtime on a regular basis...

Here you can enter scheduled downtimes that repeat regularly. This will be
explained in more detail in a separate section below.

=== Schedule downtimes on hosts

For example, if you set downtimes in the [.guihint]#Services of Host# view, the scheduled downtime would actually apply directly to all or all selected services. If this is not desired, you do not have to navigate to the [.guihint]#Status of Host# view first, but can use this option to set the downtime directly to the host.

== Displaying and deleting scheduled downtimes

Scheduled downtimes have their own view in {CMK} -- this is accessed via
[.guihint]#Views > Other > Downtimes#:

image::basics_downtimes_downtimeslist.png[]

As in every view, you can narrow the selection with the icon:icon_filter[]
filter. With the icon:commands[] commands, in this view you can remove
one or more downtime(s), and even alter them retroactively (only in the
{CEE}), e.g., if the times need to be extended when the downtime is proving
to be longer than anticipated.

[#history]
=== History

The [.guihint]#Monitor > History > Downtime history# view does not display
the current scheduled downtimes, rather their histories -- thus all events
with which a scheduled downtime began or ended (with a natural end or via
a delete command).

image::basics_downtimes_downtimes_history.png[]

[#scheduled]
== Regularly-scheduled downtimes

{cee-only}
Some maintenance is performed regulary -- a once-weekly automatic
restart of a server, for example.  Manually entering a scheduled downtime for each
occasion would be time-consuming.  If you would only like to silence the
xref:notifications#[notifications], you could configure xref:timeperiods#[time periods]
and the [.guihint]#Notification period for Hosts/Services# rules set.  These have
various restrictions however -- one important restriction being that global
configuration permissions are required for setting time periods.

For this purpose the {CEE} offer the concept of automatic,
periodically-recurring, scheduled downtimes. These can be set in two
different ways.


=== Setting via commands

The first method works in the manner we are already familiar with for one-off
scheduled downtimes -- via a command -- but with the additional
[.guihint]#Repeat this downtime on a regular basis every ...# check box.

image::basics_downtimes_periodic.png[]

With this you select the period when the maintenance should repeat. The
*first* occurrence is entered as usual. The [.guihint]#Custom time range#
button is available here. The periods are calculated from the start-time
entered. The following possibilities are available:

[cols=2]
|===

|[.guihint]#hour# |The scheduled downtime repeats hourly at the the same time
|[.guihint]#day# |Daily, at the the same time every day
|[.guihint]#week# |Recurs every seven days on the same weekday and time of day as on the first occasion
|[.guihint]#second week# |Same as for weekly, but every 14 days
|[.guihint]#fourth week# |Same as for weekly, but now every 28 days
|[.guihint]#same nth weekday (from beginning)# |With this you can achieve results such as “every second Monday in the month”. Here {CMK} takes the day of the week as the starting point, checks which day in the month it is, and bases the period on this day. If the starting date is the second Monday in the month, then a maintenance will be scheduled for the second Monday in every subsequent month.
|[.guihint]#same nth weekday (from end)# |This is similar, except that it is calculated from the end of the month -- for example “every last Friday in the Month”.
|[.guihint]#same day of the month# |In this case the weekday is irrelevant. Here the date in the month is used. So, if the starting date is the 5th, the downtime will be scheduled to occur on the 5th of each month.
|===



=== Definition using rules

An elegant alternative method for the configuration of periodic scheduled
downtimes is to define them using xref:wato_rules#[rules]. With
xref:wato_rules#hosttags[Host Tags] you can define things such as e.g.,
_Every production Windows-server has a scheduled downtime every Sunday
from 22:00 to 22:10_.

You can in fact achieve almost the same results by using the host search to
find all the affected servers, and then entering the scheduled downtime via
a command. But this functions only with *existing* servers. If in the
future a new host is added to the monitoring it will not be covered by this
entry. Alternatively, if you work with rules this will not be a problem. A
further advantage with rules is that the maintenance policy can be altered
very easily at a later date -- simply by modifying the rules.

The rules for recurring scheduled downtimes can be found under
[.guihint]#Setup > Host monitoring rules > Recurring downtimes for hosts#
respectivly [.guihint]#Setup > Service monitoring rules > Recurring downtimes for services.#

== Scheduled downtimes and availability

As mentioned at the beginning, scheduled downtimes have an effect when
evaluating the xref:availability#[availability analysis]. By default all scheduled
downtimes are calculated in their own ‘pot’ and shown in the [.guihint]#Downtime#
column.

image::basics_downtimes_availability_list.png[]

Precisely how scheduled downtimes are to be assessed can be defined via
[.guihint]#Availability > Change computation options#:

image::basics_downtimes_availability_option.png[width=50%, align=center]

[cols=2]
|===

|[.guihint]#Honor scheduled downtimes# |Scheduled downtimes are included in the availability graphs and displayed as a separate column. This is the standard procedure.
|[.guihint]#Exclude scheduled downtimes# |Scheduled downtimes are ignored completely when calculating availability. All availability statistics refer only to the remaining time. Therefore -- excluding scheduled downtimes, for what percentage of the time was the object available?
|[.guihint]#Ignore scheduled downtimes# |Scheduled downtimes will not be factored in -- only the object’s actual states are relevant.
|===


Under [.guihint]#Phases# there is the additional [.guihint]#Treat phases of UP/OK as non-downtime# option. If
this option is selected, then if the object, despite being in maintenance,
still has an {OK} or {UP} state, the times are *not* treated as scheduled
downtimes. Thus only the maintenance time that resulted in a *real*
outage will be included in the calculations.
