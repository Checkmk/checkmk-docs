[#intro]
== Introduction

In this article you will find the most important topics relevant to an update of your {CMK} from version {v20} to version {v21}.

We recommend that you read through the entire article before updating so that you know exactly what to expect: before, during and after the update.


[#prep]
== Preparations

This chapter gives you an overview of the topics you should take into consideration before you perform the update.
Probably not every topic will be relevant for you:
For each topic, you can check the corresponding box for your own reference and immediately move on to the next topic.


[#backup]
=== Backup

As with any update to production software, you should check that your backups are up to date before performing the update of {CMK}.

*Does this apply to you?* Yes.

*What do you have to do?* If you create your backups automatically via [.guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > Backups#, check there that your backups are up to date and that the most recent backup jobs have completed without errors.

For more information, see the articles on xref:backup#[Backups] and on xref:omd_basics#omd_backup_restore[Backing up and restoring sites].


[#linux_versions]
=== Linux distribution versions

In {CMK} version {v21}, some obsolete versions of the Ubuntu distribution are no longer supported.
For users of Debian, SLES, and RHEL (as well as binary-compatible derivatives such as CentOS), there are no changes.

*Does this affect you?* This will affect you if your {CMK} server has one of the following Ubuntu versions installed that are still supported in {v20}:

* Ubuntu 20.10 _Groovy Gorilla_.
* Ubuntu 21.04 _Hirsute Hippo_

Still supported at release of {v21}, but not recommended:
For Ubuntu 21.10 (_Impish Indri_), support with security updates was discontinued by Canonical during the beta phase of {v21}.
Debian 9 (_Stretch_) will also no longer receive security updates shortly after the release of {CMK} {v21}.

New additions are Debian 11 _Bullseye_ and Ubuntu 22.04 _Yammy_.
For both distributions we also build installation packages of {v20} to simplify the recommended update path.

*What do you need to do?* Before updating {CMK}, first perform a version upgrade of the Linux distribution.
Make sure that the target version of the Linux distribution is supported by {CMK} {v20} *and* {v21}.

To find out which Linux distribution versions {CMK} supports, see the xref:update_matrix#[update matrix for version {v21}] and the link:https://checkmk.com/download[download page^] after selecting the {CMK} version and your Linux distribution.

If it is now necessary to perform a version upgrade of your Linux distribution before updating {CMK}, we recommend the following procedure:

. First, stop your {CMK} site:

+
[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd stop mysite
----

[start=2]
. Unmount the site's `tmp` directory:
+
[{shell}]
----
{c-root} umount /opt/omd/sites/mysite/tmp
----

[start=3]

. Move the entire `omd` directory so that no unwanted changes can occur to this in the next step.
A release upgrade usually removes all packages whose dependencies can no longer be satisfied.
One of these packages would be {CMK}.
To prevent data loss here, this step is necessary and can be performed using `mv`.

+
[{shell}]
----
{c-root} mv /opt/omd /opt/omd.bak
----

[start=4]


. Perform the Linux version upgrade according to the distributor's instructions.

. After successfully upgrading your Linux distribution, you can now return the `omd` directory that was moved to safety back into its correct place:

+
[{shell}]
----
{c-root} mv /opt/omd.bak /opt/omd
----

[start=6]

. Now install the package from {CMK} that matches the new version of the distribution you are using.
*Important:* The {CMK} version number must be exactly the same as the one that was in use previously.
For example, if you were using {CMK} {v20}p23 before upgrading the distribution, now install the {v20}p23 that matches your new Linux distribution version.

+
In the case of Ubuntu, the following command would suffice at this point:
+
[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt install /tmp/check-mk-enterprise-2.0.0p23_0.jammy_amd64.deb
----
+

*Note:* During installation, specify the full file path to the DEB file via `apt install`.

When reinstalling {CMK}, follow the xref:install_packages#distribution_instructions[detailed installation instructions] relevant for your distribution.


[#agents]
=== The agents for Linux and Windows

With {v21} {CMK} is introducing two new components, the _Agent Controller_ (on the host), and the _Agent Receiver_ (on the server), for the Linux and Windows agents on x86/64, which allow TLS encrypted transmission of the agent output.
The Agent Controller will initially operate in a compatibility mode (*legacy pull mode*) that also allows access from {v20} sites.

*Does this affect you?* Yes.

*What do you need to do?* Identify those Windows hosts in the monitoring that use the Windows server operating systems 2008 R2 and client operating systems 7 or higher on x86_64.
The same applies for Linux hosts on x86_64 that use `systemd` version 220 or later for service management.
On these hosts, register with the monitoring server following the update to be able to use TLS encrypted transmission.
For more detailed information, see the instructions for xref:agent_linux#registration[Linux] or xref:agent_windows#registration[Windows].


[#local_files]
=== Local files

Local files allow you to customize and extend the functionality provided by {CMK}.
These files are located in the local part of the site's directory structure, i.e. in `~/local`.
Local files can cause problems when updating, as they may not match the new {CMK} version.

*Does this affect you?* Since it is not possible for {CMK} to intercept and handle local customizations or any third-party extension during an update, you should check your {CMK} site before an update to see if any local files are used on your system, and if so, which ones.

*What do you need to do?* Get an overview of the local files on your {CMK} site by running the following command as the site user (where the `-L` option ensures that symbolic links are also followed):

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} find -L ~/local -type f
----

In a freshly-installed {CMK}, you should see only a file named `README.TXT` listed at this time.
Anything beyond that should be at the top of your list for troubleshooting, in case there are problems during the update.
Special attention should be paid to check plug-ins that still follow the old check API that was valid until version {v16}.
We will go into this in more detail in the next chapter.


[#check-api]
=== The Check API

A new Check API was introduced in {CMK} {v20} which restructured the Check plug-ins to unify and simplify their handling.
However, since there are a large number of checks that were programmed for the old Check API which was valid until version {v16}, migrating from the old to the new Check API may also be an issue for you in version {v21}.
The large number of existing checks is also the reason why the old Check API will continue to be supported for a transition period.

*Does this affect you?* The Check API issue _may_ affect you if you have extended the checks shipped with {CMK} with your own, self-written checks and/or if you use plug-ins from other sources and have downloaded these, e.g. from the link:https://exchange.checkmk.com/[{CMK} Exchange^].
The issue will affect you if one, some or even all of these check plug-ins still follow the old check API.
The affected files can be found in your site's xref:local_files[local files].

*What do you have to do?* We try to make the change to the new Check API as easy and convenient as possible for you: 

Just as when updating to version {v20}, {CMK} tries to automatically migrate all local plug-ins from the directories `~/local/share/check_mk/checks` and `~/local/share/check_mk/inventory` to the new Check API when updating to version {v21}.
This 'automigration' happens at runtime; the plug-in files are not changed.
For information on how to view the results following the update, see chapter xref:automigration[Verify automigration to the Check API].

While chances are good that the automigration of your check plug-ins will work smoothly, the switch to Python 3, also implemented in version {v20}, may require some adaptations.
Due to the new Check API and the Python 3 code base, there are now two good reasons to revise your self-written check plug-ins.
We will provide you with detailed information on what you need to do in the link:https://checkmk.com/blog/migrating-check-plug-ins-to-checkmk-2-0[blog post on migrating check plug-ins.^]

Last but not least, the new Check API scores with its improved documentation:
There is an introductory article on xref:devel_check_plugins#[programming your own check plug-ins] as well as the always up to date plug-in API reference documentation.
Both can be accessed from the {CMK} interface -- in the [.guihint]#Help# menu of the navigation bar under [.guihint]#Developer resources.#


[#incompatible_mkps]
=== Incompatible and obsolete MKPs

Your monitoring system can be extended quite easily and conveniently via the xref:glossar#mkp[{CMK} extension packages (MKPs)].
On the one hand, it can be the case that such MKPs are no longer maintained and may then no longer be compatible with new versions of {CMK}.
On the other hand, we keep adding new plug-ins and functional extensions to {CMK}, which is why MKPs sometimes simply become obsolete, and their functionality will be provided by {CMK} itself.

*Does this affect you?* If you have MKPs installed, for this reason a check of these MKPs is strongly recommended -- especially before a major update.
This will prevent incompatible packages from interfering with the update, or the creation of duplicate or at least very similar services following the update.

*What do you need to do?* To do this, check your installed MKPs against our link:https://checkmk.com/integrations[Catalog of Check Plug-ins^] and remove packages which are now provided natively by {CMK}.
You can also use this opportunity to remove MKPs that may have only been installed for a test run.
A listing can be found via [.guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > Extension packages#.

On the command line, you can view installed extensions with the following command:


[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp list
my_mkp_from_exchange
my_personal_mkp
----

Then for each listed MKP you can subsequently also display the files that belong to the package:


[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp list my_personal_mkp
/omd/sites/mysite/local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/check_mk.py
/omd/sites/mysite/local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics/custom_metrics.py
----

Should you not be able to assign all packages via the check of the installed MKPs and the comparison with our catalog, the xref:dry_run[test run of the update,] described hereafter is recommended to identify incompatibilities in the process and then before the update remove these from your production monitoring.


[#mkp_backport]
==== MKP management from versions {v20}p33 and {v21}p21

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Risk of loss of settings!*
When updating the major version, {CMK} deletes rules that are no longer required.
If you uninstall packages _before_ the update in order to install a new version _after_ the update, settings that are still required may be lost.
Instead, always install new and old packages in parallel as described in this section and only remove old packages after the update.
====

To facilitate updates, {CMK} {v20}p33 and {v21}p21 introduced the ability to maintain MKPs in different versions.
When updating, the package for {CMK} {v20} is then automatically deactivated and the one for {CMK} {v21} automatically activated.
When operating a distributed monitoring with a xref:glossar#distributed_setup[centralized configuration], you can use this feature to xref:dist_setup[distribute] packages in versions that can differ between the remote sites and the central site.

This works even if the remote sites have a higher version than the central site, as is the case when updating in a distributed monitoring during a transitional period.

Note that you can only use this feature if you use at least {v20}p33 as the initial version and upgrade to {v21}p21 or higher!
If these requirements are met, you can add additional packages for {v21} on the central site.

When installing an MKP written for {CMK} {v21}, you will get a warning message when using {CMK} {v20}p33 and higher:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp install /tmp/hello_world-0.2.1.mkp 
The package requires Check_MK version 2.1.0, but you have 2.0.0p33 installed.
----

This package is identified in the list of packages as being [.guihint]#Enabled (inactive on this site)#:


[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp list
Name        Version Title        Req. Version Until Version Files State                          
----------- ------- ------------ ------------ ------------- ----- -------------------------------
hello_world 0.2.1   Hello world! 2.1.0        2.1.999       6     Enabled (inactive on this site)
hello_world 0.2.0   Hello world! 2.0.0        2.0.999       6     Enabled (active on this site)
----

Details on the revised package management function can be found in the xref:mkps#[article on extension package (MKPs) management].


[#incompatible]
=== Incompatible changes

As in every {CMK} version, there are alterations to the software in the current version {v21} that _may_ have repercussions on your {CMK} installation.
A so-called _incompatible change_ requires that you make manual modifications in order to allow existing functions to continue to run as usual and/or to be able to use new functions.

*Does this affect you?* In general, there will be incompatible changes that will also affect your {CMK} installation, it is however impossible to make a general statement.
In this article we have collected those issues that apply to all or most {CMK} installations.
In any case there may be additional changes that are relevant to you, for example in checks that you use in your installation.

*What do you need to do?* Once you have performed the xref:update[update], the {CMK} interface will show you the number and content of any incompatible changes, and prompt you to review and take note of them.
So you will definitely be confronted with this issue -- but only after you have performed the update.

It is therefore a good idea to get an overview of the incompatible changes *before* the update:
Open the list of link:https://checkmk.com/werks?search=&cmk_version$$[$$$$]$$=2.1&compatible=0[Werks^].
(The software development of {CMK} is organized in so-called Werks).
In the description of a Werk, you will find instructions on what, if anything, needs to be done to make the change compatible.

The frustrating news:
A version's Werks list is very, very long -- even if it contains only the incompatible changes.
The comforting news:
You will be able to see from the number of changes how much effort we put into improving {CMK} for you.


[#update]
== Updates

[#dry_run]
=== Best practices when updating

In this section we describe the best practices that we follow even when updating large {CMK} environments.
These are certainly not mandatory in every environment, but they can make the process of updating easier for you.


==== Update the operating system

The operating system on a {CMK} server should in any case always be up to date.
However, before updating {CMK}, it certainly does not hurt to make sure of the operating system's currency beforehand, by using `apt` (for Debian and Ubuntu), `yum` (for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based systems) or `zypper` (for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server).


==== Update the {CMK} version

Before updating to version {v21}, the {CMK} site must have version {v20} installed.

We have previously advised against omitting an intermediate major version when performing a major update, as there are simply too many changes in between that will hinder a smooth update and almost certainly cause problems.
With link:https://checkmk.com/werk/13320[Werk #13320^], this recommendation has now been made into a requirement -- and a lock introduced that prevents, for example, a direct update from version {v16} to {v21}.

An update to version {v21} does not currently require a specific {v20} patch version.
However, again, there are good reasons to start the jump to {v21} only from the latest {v20} patch version, since, for example, a {v20} patch may contain fixes that make it easier to update to version {v21}.

For this reason, we recommend updating {CMK} to the latest {v20} patch version first, and only then updating to the {v21}.


==== Perform a test run of the update

In large environments, where obviously even restoring a current backup of your {CMK} environment could take quite some time, it is recommended to perform a test with a cloned site before updating the production environment.
For this purpose, you can, for example, restore the last regular backup of your site under a different name.

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd restore newsite /path/to/backup
----

*Alternatively* you can also copy your site using `omd cp`.
For this, however, the site must be stopped for a short time:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd stop mysite
{c-root} omd cp mysite newsite
----

Then, perform the update first on this new cloned site, for example to check the above mentioned local changes in the new environment.


[#automatic_agent_updates]
==== Temporarily disable agent updates


{cee-only}
If you are using the automatic agent updates, you should consider disabling them temporarily before updating {CMK} so as to be able to later switch to the new agents at the hosts in a controlled manner.
To do this, first select [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX# and on the following page select the menu item [.guihint]#Agents > Automatic updates.#
By clicking on the icon:icon_edit[alt="Icon to edit a list entry."] button in front of the [.guihint]#Master switch# you can disable the agent update completely:

image::update_major_automatic_agent_updates.png[alt=" Disabling agent update using the master switch."]

Following a successful update of {CMK}, you can reactivate the agent update in the same way.

At this point, we recommend that you initially only reactivate the automatic agent update for individual hosts or host groups.
By doing so, the new agent will not be rolled out to all of your servers right away and you can familiarize yourself with the newly delivered data on a few systems.
Also, due to the significant increase in the number of check plug-ins supplied, you might find a whole new set of services that you can then set up properly on the test systems you choose.
You may also need new thresholds for new services.
If you tackle this on a small scale first, you will be able to minimize unnecessary false positives.

To do this, you can simply enter a few hosts or host groups in the appropriate fields on the above page and then re-enable the [.guihint]#Master switch#.

image::update_major_activate_update_on_selected_hosts.png[alt="Options when updating agents to activate on specific hosts."]

*Important:* Remember to remove these restrictions on explicit hosts and host groups again once you are satisfied with the results.


[#notifications]
==== Temporarily disable notifications

You should also consider turning off xref:glossar#notification[notifications] in the pre-update site -- for similar reasons to the ones we explained in the previous section on automatic agent updates.
This way you avoid your colleagues from the monitoring team receiving _unnecessary_ notifications.

You can turn off notifications centrally with the main [.guihint]#Notifications# switch in the xref:user_interface#master_control[Master control] snapin.

It may will happen that after the update one or another service is {CRIT} which had not been the case previously.
Take care of new problems after the update first.
You can also view any unhandled problems, e.g. in the xref:user_interface#overview[Overview] snapin.

*Important:* Don't forget to turn on the notifications again, e.g. when the number of unhandled problems after the update has leveled off to the level before the update.


[#update_distributed_monitoring]
=== Updates in distributed monitoring

You have a number of procedures for performing the update of the sites involved in a xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring], i.e. the central site and the remote sites.

*Important:* Whichever approach you choose:
In this scenario, you should also create xref:backup#[backups] beforehand.

The recommended, safe procedure is _update in one go_, where you perform the following steps:

. Stop all sites .
. Perform the update for all sites.
. Restart the updated sites.

There is another variant: the _Update on the fly_.
This procedure is required, among other things, when you manage a large number of distributed sites that cannot be updated in one go for technical or organizational reasons.

When updating on the fly, sites with different {CMK} versions must communicate with each other for a transition period -- until the update of all sites involved is complete.
For this cooperation to work, the versions involved in such a mixed operation must be compatible.


[#compat_chart]
==== Compatibility table

With link:https://checkmk.com/werk/13313[Werk #13313^], version checks have been added to ensure that the sites involved are using compatible versions.
To summarize:
Sites must have the same {CMK} major version -- with one exception: the {CMK} version of a remote site may be exactly one major version higher than that of the central site.
The following table shows the possible combinations when updating from {v20} to {v21}:

[cols="40,40,~",options="header"]
|===
|Central site |Remote site |Allowed?
|{v20} |{v20} |Yes
|{v20} |{v21} |Yes
|{v21} |{v20} |*No*
|{v21} |{v21} |Yes
|===

For patch versions, the same applies in principle as mentioned above:
The central site must never use a higher version than the remote sites.
However, deviations greater than one _patch_ version are often allowed.
For specific details on compatibility, see the link:https://checkmk.com/werks/[Werks^].

It follows from these rules that when updating on the fly, the central site is updated last.
Note that the following also applies when updating in a distributed monitoring: major versions must not be omitted, so that, for example, a connection between a {v16} and a {v21} site is not supported.

*Note:* Since the feature set of different {CMK} versions differs, some features of {CMK} may not work in this mixed mode or may work only in a limited way.
In a mixed operation, problems can occur even with compatible versions, and smooth interaction is only ensured if all sites have the same major version.
You should therefore keep the period of a mixed operation with different versions as short as possible and update all sites quickly after starting the update.


[#dist_setup]
==== MKPs in a distributed setup

If you are running a distributed monitoring with a xref:glossar#distributed_setup[central configuration] from which xref:glossar#mkp[{CMK} extension packages (MKPs)] are also distributed to the remote sites, you have the option to keep packages for the remote sites in versions for {v20} and {v21} on the {CMK} {v20} central site.
The MKPs matching the remote sites will then be distributed automatically.

To use this feature, you must first update the central site to patch version {v20}p33.
Once this has been done, you can start adding additional xref:mkp_backport[packages for {v21} on the central site].
Now, when you upgrade remote sites to {v21}p21, they will automatically receive and activate the package matching the new version.


=== Performing the update

Nothing fundamental has changed with the actual update of the software in {CMK} {v21}, i.e. you install the new version, perform the update of the {CMK} site, rectify any possible conflicts and check and confirm the incompatible changes.

Perform the update procedure as described in the xref:update#detailed[article on updates and upgrades].


[#follow-up]
== Follow-ups

[#gui]
=== Changes to the user interface

{CMK}'s user interface (GUI) was completely redesigned with version {v20}.
In the new version {v21}, on the other hand, it will look very familiar to you, since at first glance there have been very few visible changes made compared to {v20}.
However, menus, menu items, and other details have been modified to make new features available -- and to improve existing ones.

In the articles of this User guide we will present these changes, and in the xref:intro_setup#[Setting up {CMK}] you will find a detailed introduction to the most important elements of the xref:intro_gui#[user interface].


==== Snapins removed from the sidebar

With link:https://checkmk.com/werk/13736[Werk #13736^], some obsolete and little-used xref:glossar#snapin[snapins] for the sidebar have been removed.
There are replacements for almost all of these snapins, mostly via menu items in the xref:glossar#navigation_bar[navigation bar.]


[#automigration]
=== Verify automigration to the Check API

You can check if all local plug-ins in the `~/local/share/check_mk/checks` and `~/local/share/check_mk/inventory` directories can be automatically migrated to the new xref:check-api[Check API].

*Does this affect you?* This check is useful if there are check plug-ins in your local files that were programmed conforming with the old Check API that was valid until version {v16}.

*What do you need to do?* Run the following command as a a site user:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -R
Failed to auto-migrate legacy plugin to check plugin: mssql_counters
Please refer to Werk 10601 for more information.
----

The message above shows that a plug-in could not be migrated automatically.
All of the plug-ins on the list will need to be migrated manually.
There are a number of reasons why automigration cannot be performed, which you can read about in the aforementioned link:https://checkmk.com/werk/10601[Werk #10601^].
You can read how to perform manual migration in the link:https://checkmk.com/blog/migrating-check-plug-ins-to-checkmk-2-0[blog post on migrating check plug-ins.^]


[#service_discovery]
=== Updating services

As with every major version, {CMK} {v21} introduces a whole new set of check plug-ins.
If you do not use the xref:wato_services#discovery_check['discovery check'], i.e. the automatic update of the service configuration via the periodic service discovery, you will have to search for services on quite a number of hosts.

If your hosts are organized accordingly (e.g. in folders), you can generally use the [.guihint]#Bulk discovery# function for this.
This function can be found under [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts# and then in the [.guihint]#Hosts > Discover services# menu.

Below we list some areas with the most new features.


[#service_check_mk_agent]
==== The Check_MK and Check_MK Agent services

image::update_major_check_mk_services.png[alt="The two services 'Check_MK' and 'Check_MK Agent' in monitoring."]

The [.guihint]#Check_MK# and [.guihint]#Check_MK Agent# services still have the same names as in version {v20}, but these operate in a somewhat different way in {v21}:

* The [.guihint]#Check_MK Agent# service is now always present and provides all information related to _agent deployment_, such as the version of the agent, the time of the last update, the number of agent plug-ins and local checks, or the restriction of IP addresses.
Previously, this service only took care of agent updates -- and was only available when agent updates were set up.

* Likewise, the [.guihint]#Check_MK# service is now always present -- previously it was only there when passive services were running on the host.
The service [.guihint]#Check_MK# now exclusively takes care of the _operational state_ of the agents.
This service reports on, for example, connection errors or missing data, and also shows the execution time.


[#cluster_services]
==== Cluster services

With {CMK} version {v21}, the way some xref:clustered_services#[cluster services] behave has changed.
Affected services assume the {UNKNOWN} state and require configuration adaptation.

{CMK} identifies four cluster modes:

* _Best_ (the value for the best node determines the overall state).
* _Worst_ (analog: value for the worst node)
* _Failover_ (only one node is allowed to return {OK})
* _Native Clustering_ via API function (freely programmable, e.g.: _80{nbsp}% of nodes must be {OK}_ for the cluster to be OK).

Legacy plug-ins using the old Check API previously had an additional implicit clustering capability, where the output of the assigned hosts was simply evaluated in sequence and the last individual state received determined the overall state of the cluster.
Since this behavior was not reliable, it was removed in {v21}.

In the course of porting to {v21}, we removed the _native clustering_ retrofitted to {v20} from some supplied check plug-ins when it was not useful.
Instead, we selected one from the _best_, _worst_, or _failover_ behaviors as the default.
link:https://checkmk.com/werk/12908#[This list^] shows the affected plug-ins and their new default behavior.
Also affected are plug-ins programmed in-house or obtained from the link:https://exchange.checkmk.com[{CMK} Exchange^] that do not use API integration for native cluster mode.

All of these services will assume the {UNKNOWN} state after updating to {v21} if the cluster mode once selected is no longer supported.
In these cases, use the [.guihint]#Aggregation options for clustered services# rule to define one of the three cluster modes _best_, _worst_, or _failover_.


[#service_descriptions]
==== Service descriptions

Each update of {CMK} will involve changing service descriptions to improve the consistency of naming within the monitoring and documentation of {CMK}.
Since changing service descriptions means that rules sometimes need to be modified and historical monitoring data is lost, {CMK} initially leaves the old descriptions in place for updates.
For services where the loss of old monitoring data is acceptable and the effort for adapting rules is manageable, you should switch to new service descriptions as soon as possible.

To do this, go to [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global Settings > Execution of checks# and go through the list [.guihint]#Use new service descriptions# and identify the services where the checkboxes are not yet active and activate them.
After applying the changes, the new service descriptions will be active and a few minutes will pass before you see the defined states of the affected services in the monitoring again.


[#new_ports]
=== New ports

To perform xref:agent_registration[TLS registration] of hosts in the monitoring, they need access to port 443 (respectively 80) for REST API requests and port 8000 (new component _Agent Receiver_).
If necessary, be sure to configure routing and firewall settings to allow these hosts to access these ports on the {CMK} server.

If security policies prevent you from making these ports available, you can perform a xref:agent_linux#proxyregister[registration by proxy] directly on the {CMK} server.


[#agent_registration]
=== Registering agents for TLS

After updating the agents to {v21}, the [.guihint]#Check_MK Agent# service assumes {WARN} status for the affected hosts and displays the message _TLS is not activated on monitored_ host.
In the two articles on the xref:agent_linux#[Linux] and xref:agent_windows#[Windows] agents, we describe the registration of the certificates in use with the `cmk-agent-ctl` command line tool.
This tool also provides many options for automatic registration -- for example, via post-installation snippet in xref:bakery_api#[Bakery plug-ins].

If unencrypted data transfer is desired for a transition period for the parallel operation of {v20} servers in a {v21} environment, modify the [.guihint]#Checkmk Agent installation auditing# ruleset to allow the [.guihint]#Check_MK Agent# service to assume {OK} status despite the lack of registration.


[#kubernetes]
=== The new Kubernetes monitoring

Kubernetes monitoring has been rewritten from the ground up in {CMK} {v21} and now enables a simplified and efficient monitoring.
Unfortunately, because the architecture has fundamentally changed in version {v21}, it is not possible to carry over or rewrite any previous monitoring data collected from your Kubernetes objects under previous {CMK} versions.

*Does this affect you?* This affects you if you used the {CMK} special agent to monitor Kubernetes in version {v20}.
The old special agent and associated check plug-ins will still work in version {v21}, but will subsequently be xref:kubernetes_20[removed] from {CMK}.
We therefore recommend a complete move to the new, much improved Kubernetes monitoring in version {v21}.

*What do you need to do?* Completely redeploy Kubernetes monitoring as described in the xref:monitoring_kubernetes#[Monitoring Kubernetes] article.


[#encrypt_notification_spooler]
=== Encrypting the notification spooler

*Does this affect you?*
If you use distributed monitoring with xref:notifications#async[centralized notification], you will benefit from increased security when enabling data transfer encryption in the `mknotifyd` notification spooler.

*What do you need to do?*
When updating existing {CMK} installations, connections that have already been configured will initially remain usable without encryption.
However, in this case [.guihint]#Analyze configuration# will fault the setting with {CRIT}.
After migrating all involved sites to {v21}, change [.guihint]#Global settings > Notification spooler configuration > Encryption# to [.guihint]#Encrypt communication with TLS#.
New connections automatically use TLS encryption when they are created.


[#rest-api]
=== The REST API replaces the Web API

The Web API (also known as xref:web_api#[HTTP API]) has been discontinued and will be xref:web-api[unavailable] in the next {CMK} version.
Its replacement is ready as the xref:rest_api#[REST API] introduced in version {v20}.

*Does this affect you?* This affects you if you have written custom scripts that use the Web API.

The Web API will continue to work in this {CMK} version,
and in existing sites updated from version {v20} to {v21}, the Web API will remain enabled.
In sites newly created with the {v21} version, the Web API will have already been disabled in the [.guihint]#Global settings#.
The switch to turn the Web API on and off can be found in [.guihint]#Setup > General > Global settings > Site management > Disable Web API#.

*What do you need to do?* We recommend migrating all existing scripts that use the Web API to the REST API as soon as possible in order to catch any possible problems early, before upgrading to {CMK} version {v22}.

The REST API already provides access to more areas in {CMK} than the Web API, such as host status, service status, scheduled downtimes, time periods, problem acknowledgement, and Business Intelligence (BI).

The functions for accessing sites in a distributed monitoring, and metrics and graphs that are still missing from the REST API will be added in {v21} patch versions, so that over time all functions that could also be used in the Web API will again be available.


[#remove_old_mkps]
=== Removing obsolete MKPs

*Does this affect you?* This will affect you if you have made use of the feature to keep xref:mkp_backport[MKPs in differing versions].

*What do you need to do?* During the update, incompatible packages will be automatically set to the [.guihint]#Disabled# state, but not completely deleted.
Packages compatible with the new {CMK} version will be automatically enabled, and you will see the [.guihint]#Enabled (active on this site)# state.

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp list
Name        Version Title        Req. Version Until Version Files State                          
----------- ------- ------------ ------------ ------------- ----- -----------------------------
hello_world 0.2.1   Hello world! 2.1.0        2.1.999       6     Enabled (active on this site)
hello_world 0.2.0   Hello world! 2.0.0        2.0.999       6     Disabled
----

Once the functionality of the new packages has been verified and the old ones are no longer needed for reference, you can search for obsolete packages:


[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp list | grep Disabled
----

Then uninstall them with `mkp remove`.

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} mkp remove hello_world 0.2.0
----


[#outlook]
== The outlook

This chapter covers topics not directly related to the current {CMK} version {v21}, but to one of its subsequent versions.


[#web-api]
=== The Web API is being removed

The Web API (also called HTTP API) will be removed in the next {CMK} version {v22}.
The Web API will be replaced by the xref:rest-api[REST API] introduced in {v20}.


[#kubernetes_20]
=== The old Kubernetes special agent will be removed.

The {CMK} {v20} special agent for Kubernetes monitoring and its associated check plug-ins will be removed in the next {CMK} version {v22}.
Details can be found under the link:https://checkmk.com/werk/13561[Werk #13561^].
Replacements are provided in version {v21} by the completely rewritten xref:kubernetes[new Kubernetes monitoring].


[#nsca]
=== NSCA will no longer be supported

Support for the Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA) will be removed in the next {CMK} version {v22}.

NSCA is a Nagios add-on for getting results from passive xref:monitoring_basics#checks[checks] on remote hosts in a distributed Nagios configuration.
This deprecated method for setting up xref:distributed_monitoring#[distributed monitoring] offers no advantages over {CMK}'s own methods.

Details and notes on its replacement can be found in link:https://checkmk.com/werk/13644[Werk #13644^].


[#hw_sw_inventory_plugin_api]
=== The old HW/SW Inventory plug-in API is no longer supported

Support for the old HW/SW Inventory plug-in API will be removed in the next {CMK} version {v22}.

The plug-ins following this API are located in the site directory under `~/share/check_mk/inventory` and (as local files) under `~/local/share/check_mk/inventory`.
These plug-ins will work in version {v21}, but will be ignored in version {v22} and later.

If you use custom plug-ins, migrate these to the new Check API before updating to version {v22}.
See link:https://checkmk.com/werk/14084[Werk #14084^] for more details and information on migration.
