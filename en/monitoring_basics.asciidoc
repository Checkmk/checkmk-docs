== States and events

Until now we have been concerned with the installation and implementation
of {CMK}.  Now it is time to begin explaining the basic concepts and
definitions of monitoring (with {CMK}).

It is important to understand the basic differences between _states_
and _events_ - and namely for a very practical benefit.  Most classic
IT monitoring systems revolve around events.  An event is something that
occurs uniquely at a particular time.  A good example would be _error when accessing drive X_. Typical sources of events are syslog messages, SNMP traps,
the Windows Event Log, and log data entries. Events
are quasi-spontaneous (self-generating, asynchronous) occurrences.

In contrast a _state_ describes a sustained situation, e.g.  _drive X
is online_. In order to observe the state of something, the monitoring
system must regularly poll it. As the example shows, in monitoring it is
often possible to choose to work with events or with states.

{CMK} can accommodate both states and events, but,
where the choice is available, always prioritize state-based monitoring. The
reason for this lies in the numerous advantages of this method. Some of
these are:

* An error in the monitoring itself is detected immediately, because it is obviously noticeable when the status query no longer works.
The non-occurrence of a _message_, on the other hand, does not give any certainty whether the monitoring is still working.
* {CMK} itself can control the rate at which states are polled.
There is no risk of an _event storm_ in global error situations.
* Regular checking in a fixed time-frame enables the capturing of xref:graphing#[metrics] to record their time history.
* Even in chaotic situations - e.g. a power failure in a computer center - one always has a reliable overall status.

One can well say that {CMK}'s state-based monitoring is the _norm_.
For the processing of states, the xref:ec#[{CMK} Event Console] is also
available.  This is specialized for the correlation and evaluation of large
numbers of events and is seamlessly-integrated into the {CMK} platform.


[#hosts_services]
== Hosts and services

[#hosts]
=== Hosts

Everything in {CMK} revolves around _hosts_ and _services_.
A host can be many things, e.g.:

* A server
* A network device (switch, router, load balancer)
* A measuring device with an IP connection (thermometer, hygrometer)
* Anything else with an IP address
* A cluster of several Hosts
* A virtual machine
* A Docker container

In monitoring a host always has one of the following states:

[cols="11,6,~"]
|===
|State |Color |Meaning 

|{UP} |green |The host is accessible via the network (this generally means that it answers a PING.)
|{DOWN} |red |The host does not answer network inquiries, is not accessible.
|{UNREACH} |orange |The _path_ to the host is currently blocked to monitoring, because a router or switch in the path has failed.
|{PEND} |gray |The host has been newly-included in the monitoring, but never before been polled. Strictly-speaking this is not really a condition.
|===


Alongside the state, a host has a number of other attributes that can be
configured by the user, e.g.:

* A unique name
* An IP address
* Optional - an alias, that must not be unique
* Optional - one or more _parents_

[#parents]
=== Parents

For the monitoring to be able to determine the {UNREACH} state, it must know which path it can use to contact each individual host.
For this purpose, one or more so-called _parent hosts_ can be specified for each host.
For example, if a server A _as seen from monitoring_ can only be reached via a router B, then B is a parent host of A.
Only _direct_ parents are xref:hosts_structure#parents[configured in {CMK}].
This then results in a tree-like structure with the {CMK} site in the middle (shown here as icon:parent_map_root[alt="Icon for the {CMK} site."]):

image::monitoring_basics_parents.png[alt="Network topology with a configured parent.",width=43%,align=center]

Let's assume that in the network topology example shown above, the hosts _myhost_ and _myhost4_ are no longer reachable.
The failure of _myhost4_ can be explained by the fact that _myhost_ has failed.
Therefore, _myhost4_ is classified as {UNREACH} in the monitoring.
It is simply not possible to clearly determine why {CMK} can no longer reach _myhost4_, and the {DOWN} status would therefore be misleading in some circumstances.
Instead, the {UNREACH} has the effect of suppressing xref:notifications#[notifications] by default.
This is after all the most important task of the parents concept, i.e. the avoidance of mass notifications in the event that an entire dependent network segment becomes unreachable for the monitoring due to an interruption at a single point.

The prevention of false alarms is also served by xref:cmc_differences#no_on-demand_host_checks[feature] of the {CMK} Micro Core (CMC) used in the {CEE}.
Here, the state change for a failed host is held back for a few moments and proceeds only when it is _certain_ that the parent is still reachable.
If, on the other hand, the parent is definitely {DOWN}, the host will switch to {UNREACH} -- without a notification being triggered.

In some cases a host could have multiple parents, for example, when a router is running highly available in a cluster.
It is sufficient for {CMK} to be able to uniquely determine the status of the host when one of these parents is reachable.
Thus, when a host has _multiple_ parents and at least one of these parents is {UP}, the host is considered reachable in the monitoring.
In other words, in such a situation, the host will not automatically switch to the {UNREACH} state.


[#services]
=== Services

A host has a number of _services_. A service can be anything - please
don't confuse this with services in Windows. A service is any part or
aspect of the host that can be {OK}, or not OK. Naturally the state can only
be determined if the host is in an {UP} condition.

A service being monitored can have the following states:

[cols="11,6,~"]
|===
|State |Color |Meaning 

|{OK} |green |The service is fully in order. All values are in their allowed range.
|{WARN} |yellow |The service is functioning normally, but its parameters are outside their optimal range.
|{CRIT} |red |The service has failed
|{UNKNOWN} |orange |The service's status cannot be correctly determined. The monitoring agent has delivered defective data or the element being monitored has disappeared.
|{PEND} |gray |The service has been newly-included and has so far not provided monitoring data.
|===


When determining which condition is 'worse', {CMK} utilizes the following
sequence:

{OK} → {WARN} → {UNKNOWN} → {CRIT}

== Host and service groups

Hosts and services can be grouped for an overview. In this way a host/service
can be in more than one group. These groups are purely optional and not
required for the configuration. Host groups can be useful when, alongside
the folder structure in which the hosts are managed, an additional grouping
is desired. If for example you have built a folder structure according to
geographic standpoints, then it could be useful to have a _Linux-Server_
host group e.g., that lists all Linux servers regardless of their geographic
locations.

== Contacts and contact groups

Contacts and xref:wato_user#contact_groups[contact groups] offer the possibility of assigning persons to hosts
and services.  A contact correlates with a user name or web interface. The
correlation with hosts and services does not occur directly however, rather
via contact groups. Firstly, a contact (e.g. `harri`) is assigned
to a contact group (e.g. `linux-admins`). Then hosts - or as required,
individual services - can be assigned to the contact group. In this way users,
and likewise hosts and services can be assigned to multiple contact groups.

These assignments are useful for a number of reasons:

. Who is permitted to _view_ something?
. Who is authorized to _configure and control_ which hosts and services?
. Who receives _notifications_ for which problems?

By the way - the user `cmkadmin`, who is automatically defined by the
creation of an instance, is always permitted to view all hosts and services
even when they are not a contact. This is determined through their role
as administrator.

== Users and roles

Whereas the persons who are responsible or authorized for a particular host
or service are defined through contacts and contact groups, their privileges
are controlled via _roles_. {CMK} is supplied with three roles from
which further roles can be later derived. Each role defines a series of rights
which may be customized. The standard roles have the following meanings:

[cols="5,10,~"]
|===
| |Role |Meaning 

|icon:icon_roles[] |`admin`  |May view all, has all privileges
|icon:icon_roles[] |`user` |May only view that for which he/she is a contact. May manage hosts in folders assigned to him/her. Is not permitted to make global settings
|icon:icon_roles[] |`guest`  |May view all, but may not configure and may not influence monitoring
|===


== Problems, events and notifications

=== Handled and unhandled problems

{CMK} identifies every host that is not {UP}, and every service that is
not {OK} as a _problem_. A problem can have two states: _unhandled_
and _handled_. The procedure is that a new problem is first treated as
unhandled. As soon as someone _confirms_ (acknowledges) the problem it
is then flagged as handled. It can also be said that unhandled problems are
those which nobody has attended to. The xref:user_interface#overview[Overview] in the sidebar
therefore differentiates the two types of problems:

image::overview_more.png[alt="Overview snapin in Show more mode.",width=50%]

By the way: service problems from hosts that are currently not {UP} are not
identified as problems.

Further details about acknowledgments can be found in it's
xref:basics_ackn#[own article].


[#notifications]
=== Notifications

When a host's condition changes, (e.g. from {OK} to {CRIT}), {CMK} registers
a _monitoring event_. These events may or may not generate a xref:glossar#notification[notification]. {CMK}
is so designed that whenever a host or service has a problem, an email is sent
to the object's contacts (please note that `cmkadmin`,
by default, is _not a_ contact for any objects). These can be customized
very flexibly however. Notifications also depends on a number of parameters. It is
simplest when we look at cases for which notifications _are not_ sent.
Notifications are suppressed ...

* ...when notifications have been globally-deactivated in the _Master control_
* ...when notifications have been deactivated in the host/services
* ...when notifications have been deactivated for a particular status of the host/services (e.g. no notifications for {WARN})
* ...when the problem affects a service whose host is {DOWN} or {UNREACH}
* ...when the problem affects a host, whose parents are all {DOWN} or {UNREACH}
* ...when for the host/service a notification period has been set that is not currently active (see below)
* ...when the host/service is currently _flapping_ (see below)
* ...when the host/service is currently in a _scheduled downtime_ (see below)

If none of these prerequisites for suppressing notifications are satisfied,
the monitoring core then creates a notification, which in a second step passes
through a chain of rules. In these rules you can define further exclusion
criteria, and decide whom should be notified and in what form (email, SMS, etc.)

All particulars concerning notifications can be found in it's
xref:notifications#[own article].

[#flapping]
=== Flapping hosts and services

It sometimes happens that a service continuously and quickly changes its
condition. In order to avoid continuous notifications, {CMK} switches
such a service into the _flapping_ state. This is illustrated with the
icon:icon_flapping[] symbol. When a service enters a flapping state,
a notification will be generated which informs the user of the change,
and silences further notifications. After a suitable time, if no further rapid
changes are occurring, and a final (good or bad) status is evident, then
the flapping status disappears and normal notifications resume.

[#downtimes]
=== Scheduled downtimes

If you perform maintenance work on a server, device or software, you will
normally want to avoid potential problem notifications during this time. In
addition, you will probably want to advise your colleagues that problems
appearing in monitoring during this time may be temporarily ignored.

For this purpose you can enter a condition of _scheduled downtimes_ on
a host or service.  This can can be done directly before starting the work,
or in advance. Scheduled downtimes are illustrated by the symbols:

[cols="5,~"]
|===

|icon:icon_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for services."] |The service is in a scheduled downtime.
|icon:icon_derived_downtime[alt="Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime for hosts."] |The host is in a scheduled downtime. Services whose host is in a downtime are also marked with this icon.
|===


While a host or service has a scheduled downtime:

* No notifications will be sent.
* Problems will not be shown in the [.guihint]#Overview#.

Additionally, when you wish to later document statistics on the availability
of hosts and services it is a good idea to include scheduled downtimes.
These can be factored into later availability evaluations.

== Time periods

[{image-left}]
image::timeperiods.png[width=8%]

Time periods define regular, weekly-recurring
time periods that are used in various positions in the monitoring's
configuration. A typical time period could be called `work hours` and
could contain the time from 8:00 to 17:00 on all weekdays except Saturday and
Sunday. The period `24X7` simply includes all times and is predefined.
Time periods can also include exceptions for particular calendar days -
e.g. Bavarian public holidays.

Some important situations which use time periods are:

* Limiting the time during which notifications will be made (notification period)
* Limiting the time during which checks are to be performed (check period)
* Service times for the evaluation of availability (service period)
* Times during which the Event Console applies defined rules

[#checkintervall]
== Check interval, check attempts and check period

The execution of checks occurs at fixed intervals in status-based monitoring.
{CMK} uses one minute as its standard. Every check is therefore performed
once per minute. This can be altered in the configuration:

* To a longer interval in order to save CPU resources on the server and target systems
* To a shorter interval in order to receive notifications more quickly and to collect performance data at a higher resolution.

Through defining a check period other than 24X7, the execution of _active_ checks
can be interrupted in specified time frames. The service's status will
no longer be updated, and will be flagged as _stale_, symbolized by
icon:icon_stale[].

In combination with a long check interval one can ensure that an active check is
performed once per day at a specified time. If you set an interval of e.g. 24
hours and the check period at 02:00 - 02:01 on every day (only one minute
per day), then {CMK} will ensure that the check really will be executed
in this short time frame.

[#max_check_attempts]
With the aid of _max check attempts_ you can
avoid notifications in the case of sporadic errors. In this way you are effectively
making a check less sensitive. If the check attempts are set to e.g. 3, and
the corresponding service becomes {CRIT}, then initially no notification will
be generated. If the the next two checks produce a result other than {OK}, the
number of current attempts will increase to 3 and a notification will be sent.

A service that finds itself in this intermediate state - is thus not {OK}, but
has not yet reached its maximum number of attempts - has a _soft state._

== Active and passive checks

If you look at the {CMK} interface you can see that for some services
in the icon:icon_menu[] menu
a  yellow arrow (icon:icon_reload[]) is shown, but a gray arrow
(icon:icon_reload_cmk[]) for most others. The services with the yellow
arrow are _active checks_. These are executed by {CMK} directly.
Services with a gray arrow are those for which the check results are determined
by the active check [.guihint]#Check_MK#. These occur for performance reasons
and illustrate a special feature of {CMK}:

image::monitoring_basics_check_mk_service.png[]

In order that the target system (server, network device, etc.) is not
newly-contacted for every single service, once per interval {CMK} collects
all important data in one pass. From this data, in a single action it
calculates new results for all passive checks. This conserves CPU resources
on both systems and is an important factor that supports {CMK}'s high
performance and scalability.

== Overview of the most important host and service icons

The following table provides a short overview of the most important status
icons appearing beside hosts and services:

[cols="5,~"]
