== Function

The incident management platform link:https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/on-call.html[Splunk On-Call^] handles the distribution of messages from dozens of different sources, which can be selected as integrations directly in the web interface.
A generic REST back-end is available for {CMK}.


== Configuring Splunk On-Call

You do not need to explicitly activate the notifications from {CMK}, only the REST endpoint address:

. In Splunk On-Call under [.guihint]#Integrations#, call the [.guihint]#REST Generic# item.
. Copy the displayed REST endpoint URL.


== Configuration in {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article about xref:notifications#[notifications].

As a reminder:

include::include_ticketsystem.asciidoc[]

Inn {CMK} you only need now to specify this key:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Splunk On-Call#.
. Enter the copied URL under [.guihint]#Splunk On-Call REST Endpoint#.
