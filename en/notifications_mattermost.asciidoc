== Function

link:https://mattermost.com[Mattermost^] is the self-hosted open source alternative to Slack, which can also be provided with notifications via webhook.


== Configuring Mattermost

If you have just set up the Mattermost server, webhooks will already be active.
However you can also enable them later in the Mattermost [.guihint]#System Console# -- i.e. the server's administration interface -- under [.guihint]#Integrations > Integration Management#.

Another prerequisite is that you have at least one group -- otherwise you will not be able to access the Web Client view at all.
Proceed as follows:

. In the group view, open [.guihint]#Integrations# from the main menu.
. Create a new webhook via [.guihint]#Incoming Webhooks > Add Incoming Webhook#.
. Enter a name and description as required, and select the channel for the postings with the notifications.

With these actions the webhook URL will be generated -- copy this URL for use in the next step.


== Configuration in {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article about xref:notifications#[notifications].

As a reminder:

include::include_ticketsystem.asciidoc[]

As with xref:notifications_slack#[Slack], an activation in {CMK} now only requires the webhook URL:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose [.guihint]#Slack or Mattermost#.
. Enter the copied webhook URL.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI within the notification.
Instead of specifying the webhook URL directly here, you can also use {CMK}'s password store and read the URL from one of its entries.

For testing you can use the [.guihint]#Fake check results# and [.guihint]#Custom notification# xref:commands#[commands].
