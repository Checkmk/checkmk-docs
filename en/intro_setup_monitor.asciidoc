[#hosts]
== Hosts, services and agents

So, {CMK} is ready. But before we start with the actual monitoring, we will
briefly explain some important terms. First of all, there is the *host*.
In {CMK}, a host is usually a server, a virtual machine (VM), a network device,
an appliance -- or generally something with an IP address that is monitored by
{CMK}. However, there are also hosts without an IP address, for instance Docker
containers. Each host always has one of the states {UP}, {DOWN} or {UNREACH}.

On each host a number of *services* are monitored. A service can be
anything -- for example, a file system, a process, a hardware sensor, a switch
port -- but it can also simply be a certain metric such as CPU utilization or RAM
usage. Each service can have one of the states {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT} or {UNKNOWN}.

In order for {CMK} to be able to request data from a host, an *agent* is
usually necessary. This is a small programme that is installed on the host and
which provides data on the state (or 'health') of the host on request.
Servers running Windows, Linux or Unix can only be effectively monitored by {CMK}
if you install a {CMK} agent there -- an agent provided by us. In the case of
network devices and many appliances, the manufacturer will usually have built-in
an agent that {CMK} can easily query using the standardised SNMP protocol.
Cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Azure alternatively provide
an interface ('API') that can be queried by {CMK} via HTTP.


[#dns]
== Preliminary considerations for DNS

Even though {CMK} does not require name resolution of hosts, a well-maintained
Domain Name System (DNS) makes configuration much easier and avoids errors,
since {CMK} will then be able to resolve the host names on its own without you
needing to enter IP addresses in {CMK}.

So setting up a monitoring system is a good opportunity to check whether your
DNS is up to date and, if necessary, to add any missing entries.


[#folders]
== Folder structures for hosts

{CMK} manages your hosts in a hierarchical tree of folders -- quite analogous to
what you know from files in your operating system. If you only monitor a handful
of hosts, this may seem not so important to you.
But remember -- {CMK} is designed to monitor thousands and tens of thousands of
hosts -- so good order can be half the battle won.

Before you include the first hosts into {CMK}, it is therefore advantageous to
think about the structure of these folders. On the one hand, the folder structure
is useful for your own overview. More importantly, however, it can be used for
the configuration of {CMK}. All configuration parameters of hosts can be defined
in a folder, which are then automatically *inherited* by its subfolders and
hosts contained there. Therefore, it is elementary, not only but especially for
the configuration of large environments, to set up a well-considered folder
structure from the beginning.

Once you have created a folder structure, you can change it -- but you must do
so very carefully. Moving a host to another folder can have the effect of
changing its parameters without you being aware of it.

The real consideration when building a folder structure that will be most useful
to you is the criteria by which you want to organise the folders. The criteria
can be different at each level of the tree. For example, you can distinguish by
location in the first level and by technology in the second level.

The following classification criteria have proven themselves in practice:

* Location/Geography
* Organisation
* Technology

Sorting by location is particularly obvious in larger companies, especially if
you distribute the monitoring over several {CMK} servers. Each server then monitors
a region or a state/country, for example. If your folders map this distribution,
then you can define, for example, in the folder 'Munich' that all hosts in this
folder are to be monitored from the {CMK} site 'muc'.

Alternatively, 'organisation' (i.e. the answer to the question 'Who is
responsible for a host?') may be a more meaningful criterion, since location
and responsibility may not always be the same. For example, it may be that one
group of your colleagues is responsible for the administration of Oracle,
regardless of the actual physical location of the corresponding hosts. If, for
example, the folder 'Oracle' is intended for the hosts of the Oracle colleagues,
it is easy to configure in {CMK} that all hosts below this folder are only visible
to these colleagues and/or that they can even maintain their hosts there themselves.

Structuring by technology could, for example, provide a folder for Windows
servers and one for Linux servers. This would simplify the implementation of the
scheme 'The `sshd` process must run on all Linux servers'. Another example
is the monitoring of devices such as switches or routers via SNMP. Here, no {CMK}
agent is used, but the devices are queried via the SNMP protocol. If these hosts
are grouped in separate folders, you can make the settings necessary for SNMP,
such as the 'Community', directly at the folder.

Since a folder structure can only rarely reflect the complexity of reality,
{CMK} provides another supplementary possibility for structuring using the
host tags -- but more on this in a separate chapter on
xref:intro_finetune#host_tags[fine-tuning the monitoring]. For more information on the folder
structure, among other things, see the xref:wato_hosts[article on host administration].


[#create_folders]
== Creating folders

You can access the administration of folders and hosts via the navigation bar,
the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, the [.guihint]#Hosts# topic and the [.guihint]#Hosts# entry.
The [.guihint]#Main directory# page is then displayed:

image::empty_main_directory.png[alt="View of 'Main directory' without folders and hosts."]

Before we create the first folder, we will briefly discuss the structure of this page,
since you will find the various elements on most {CMK} pages in the same or a
similar format. Below the page title [.guihint]#Main directory# you will find the breadcrumb
path, which shows you where you are currently located within the {CMK} interface.
Below this, the menu bar is displayed, which summarises the possible actions on
this page in menus and menu items. The menus in {CMK} are always context-specific,
i.e. you will only find menu entries for actions that make sense on the current page.

Below the menu bar you will find the action bar, in which the most important
actions in the menus are offered as buttons for direct clicking. You can hide
the action bar with the icon:button_hide_toolbar[alt="Icon for hiding the action bar."] button to the right of the
[.guihint]#Help# menu and show it again with icon:button_show_toolbar[alt="Icon for showing the action bar."]. When the
action bar is hidden, the icons are displayed in the menu bar to the right of
icon:button_show_toolbar[alt="Icon for showing the action bar."].

Since we are currently on an empty page (without folders and without hosts),
the important actions for creating the first object are additionally offered via
even larger buttons -- so that the options offered by the page cannot be overlooked.
These buttons will disappear after the first object has been created.

Now let's get back to the reason why we are on this page: the creation of folders.
_One_ folder -- the Main folder -- exists in every freshly set up {CMK} system.
It is called the [.guihint]#Main directory#, as you can see in the title of the page.
Below the Main directory, we will now create the three folders [.guihint]#Windows#,
[.guihint]#Linux# and [.guihint]#Network# as a simple exercise.

Create the first of the three folders by selecting one of the actions offered to
create a folder (e.g. the icon:icon_newfolder[alt="Icon for creating a folder."] [.guihint]#Add subfolder# button).
On the new page [.guihint]#Create new folder# enter the folder name in the first box [.guihint]#Basic settings#:

image::folder_basic_settings.png[alt="Dialogue with properties when creating a folder: 'Basic settings' with title."]

In the above image, the xref:intro_gui#show_less_more[Show less mode] is active and
only the entry that is absolutely necessary for creating a folder is displayed.
Confirm the entry with [.guihint]#Save#.

Analogous to the [.guihint]#Windows# folder, create the other two folders [.guihint]#Linux# and
[.guihint]#Network#. After that, the situation will look like this:

image::three_empty_folders.png[alt="View of 'Main directory' with three folders, one of them expanded with icons for folder actions."]

*Tip:* When you point the mouse at the tab or the top of a folder icon,
the folder unfolds to reveal the icons you need to perform important actions with
the folder (change the properties, move the folder or delete it, etc.).

*One more tip:* At the top right of each page you will find the information
whether -- and if so, how many -- changes have already been accumulated in the
meantime. Since we have created three folders, there are three changes,
but they do not need to be activated yet. We will deal with activating changes
in more detail below.


[#linux]
==  Adding the first host

Now everything is in place and ready to add the first host to the monitoring -- and
what could be more obvious than to monitor the {CMK} server itself?
It won't be able to report its own total failure of course, but this is still useful
because it gives you not only an overview of CPU and RAM usage, but also several
metrics and checks concerning the {CMK} system itself.

The procedure for including a Linux host (as well as a Windows host, by the way)
is in principle always the following:

. Download the agent
. Install the agent
. Create the host

After creating the host, the setup is completed by configuring the services and
activating the changes, which we will describe next.


[#download_agent]
=== Downloading the agent

Since the {CMK} server is a Linux machine, you need the {CMK} agent for Linux.

In the {EE}, [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX# takes you to a page
that also gives you access to the xref:wato_monitoringagents#bakery[Agent Bakery]
with which you can 'bake' individually configured agent packages.
In addition, however, a generic agent that you can download immediately is always offered:

image::agent_download_cee.png[alt="List of Linux agents for download in the {EE}."]

{cre-only}
The {RE} does not have an agent bakery. In this version, [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Linux#
will take you directly to the download page, where you will find pre-configured
agents and agent plug-ins:

image::agent_download_page.png[alt="List of Linux agents for download in the {RE}."]

Download the package file. Choose the RPM file format for Red Hat, CentOS and SLES
or the DEB file format for Debian and Ubuntu.


[#install_agent]
=== Installing the agent

For the following installation example, we assume that the downloaded package
file is located in the `/root` directory, i.e. in the home directory of
the `root` user. If you have downloaded the file to another directory,
replace the `/root` directory definition with the actual directory in the
following installation command. Similarly, replace the name of the package file
with the name of the file you downloaded.

The package file is only needed during the installation and it can be deleted after completing the installation.

*Note:* In our example, the agent is installed on the {CMK} server,
i.e. you do not need to copy the package file to another computer.
If the downloaded file is not on the host targetted for the installation of
the agent, you must first copy the file to the target host, for example with
the command line tool `scp`. This is done in the same way as for the
installation of the {CMK} software and as described for the Linux installation,
e.g. for the xref:install_packages_debian[installation under Debian and Ubuntu].

The installation is performed as `root` on the command line, for the RPM
file with `rpm`, preferably with the `-U` option, which stands for
_upgrade_ and which ensures that the installation goes through without
errors even if an old version of the agent is already installed:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} rpm -U /root/check-mk-agent-2.0.0b5-a38356026f314d52.noarch.rpm
----

Or for the DEB file with the `dpkg -i` command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} dpkg -i /root/check-mk-agent_2.0.0b5-a38356026f314d52_all.deb
----

*Important:* The agent requires either the background programme
(_daemon_) `systemd`, which is standard on newer Linux distributions,
or the auxiliary daemon `xinetd`. You can see which daemon is running on
your computer from the output when you install the agent:

[cols="20,~"]
|===
|Agent running ... |Output 

|with `xinetd` |`Reloading xinetd...`
|with `systemd` |`Enable {CMK} agent in systemd...`
|none |Neither of the above two messages, instead: `This package needs xinetd to be installed for full functionality.`
|===


If you have neither `systemd` nor `xinetd`,
simply install `xinetd` later. This can be done on RedHat/CentOS with:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} yum install xinetd
----

on SLES with:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} zypper install xinetd
----

and on Debian/Ubuntu with:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} apt install xinetd
----

This completes the installation of the agent.

The {CMK} agent for Linux is an executable programme (shell script) that you can
test very easily by invoking the `check_mk_agent` command:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} check_mk_agent
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 2.0.0b5
AgentOS: linux
Hostname: mycmkserver
AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
LocalDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local
...
----

The output from the `check_mk_agent` command is very, very long,
so we have only listed the first few lines here.

To test the accessibility of the agent from outside, you can try a connection on
port 6556 from another computer via `telnet`. Here the agent should
respond with this same output:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-root} telnet mycmkserver 6556
Trying 192.168.178.34...
Connected to mycmkserver.
Escape character is '^]'.
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 2.0.0b5
AgentOS: linux
Hostname: mycmkserver
...
----

*Note:* By default, the agent is accessible from the entire network and can
be queried without a password. However, since the agent does not accept any
commands from the network, a would-be attacker cannot gain access. Information
such as the list of current processes is visible, however. You can find out how
to secure the agent in the article on the xref:agent_linux[Linux agent].


[#create_host]
=== Creating a host

After installing the agent on the host, you can add the host to the monitoring -- in
the already-prepared [.guihint]#Linux# folder. Just a reminder: In this example,
the {CMK} server and the host to be monitored are identical.

In the {CMK} interface, open the same [.guihint]#Main directory# page where you have
already created the three folders: [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts#.
There, change to the [.guihint]#Linux# folder by clicking on that folder.

Click [.guihint]#Add host# and the [.guihint]#Add host# page will open:

image::host_allsettings_less.png[alt="Dialogue with properties when creating a host."]

As with the creation of the three folders above, the xref:intro_gui#show_less_more[Show less mode]
is still active. Therefore, {CMK} only shows the most important host parameters
in the form -- the ones that are necessary to create a host.
If you are interested, you can see the rest by clicking the three ellipsis
icon:button_showmore[alt="Icon for switching to Show more mode."] at each of the open boxes and opening the two collapsed
boxes at the bottom of the page. As mentioned at the beginning, {CMK} is a complex
system that has an answer to every question.
That's why you can configure so much on a host (but not only there).

*Tip:* On many pages -- including this one -- you can also display help
texts for the parameters. To do this, select [.guihint]#Show inline help# from the
[.guihint]#Help# menu. The selected setting remains active on other pages until you
switch off the help again.

But now for the inputs for creating the first host. You only have to fill in one
field, namely [.guihint]#Hostname# in the [.guihint]#Basic settings#.

You can freely assign this name. However, you should know that the host name is
of central importance, because it serves as an internal ID (or key) for
unambiguous identification of the host at all points in the monitoring.
Since it is so important in {CMK} and is often used, you should think carefully
about the naming of your hosts. A host name can be changed at a later date,
but as this is a time-consuming process, you should avoid it.

It is best if the host can be resolved under its name in the DNS. If this is the
case, you will be finished with this form. If not, or if you do not want to use DNS,
you can also enter the IP address manually in the [.guihint]#IPv4 Address# field.

*Note:* To ensure that {CMK} can always run stably and with good performance,
it maintains its own cache for the resolution of host names. For this reason,
the failure of the DNS service does not lead to a failure of the monitoring.
The details on host names, IP addresses and DNS can be found in the article on
xref:wato_hosts#dns[managing hosts].

Before we go any further, the initial host must first be completely created.
We are not there yet -- even though we are getting close to it.


[#diagnosis]
=== Diagnostics

Murphy's law -- _"Everything that can go wrong will go wrong"_ -- can unfortunately not
be repealed for {CMK}. Things can go wrong, especially when you are trying them
for the first time. Good tools for diagnosing errors are therefore important.

Already when creating a host, {CMK} offers not only to save the entries (host name and IP address)
on the [.guihint]#Create new host# page, but also to test the connection to the host.
In the action bar on the [.guihint]#Create new host# page you will find, among other things,
the [.guihint]#Save & go to connection tests# button. Click on this button.

The [.guihint]#Test connection to host# page will appear and {CMK} will try to reach the
host in various ways. For Linux and Windows hosts only the two upper boxes are interesting:

image::host_diagnostics.png[alt="Result of the connection test to the host with ping and with agent output."]

The output in the [.guihint]#Agent# box assures you that {CMK} can successfully communicate
with the agent you have previously installed manually on the host.

In further boxes you can see how {CMK} tries to make contact via SNMP.
This predictably leads to SNMP errors in this example, but this is very useful
for network devices, which we will discuss below.

On this page you can try a different IP address in the [.guihint]#Host Properties# box
if necessary, run the test again and even transfer the changed IP address directly
to the host properties with [.guihint]#Save & go to host properties#.

Click this button (whether you have changed the IP address or not) and you will
land on the [.guihint]#Properties of host# page.


[#services]
== Configuring services

Once the host itself has been included, the really interesting part begins -- the
configuration of its services. On the host properties page mentioned above,
click [.guihint]#Save & go to service configuration# and the [.guihint]#Services of host# page will appear.

On this page you specify which services you want to monitor on the host. If the
agent on the host is accessible and running correctly, {CMK} automatically finds
a number of services and suggests them for monitoring (shown here in an abbreviated form):

image::intro_setup_monitor_services_of_host.png[alt="List of services found on the host for adding to monitoring."]

For each of these services, there are in principle the following possibilities:

* [.guihint]#Undecided# : You have not yet decided whether to monitor this service.
* [.guihint]#Monitored# : The service is being monitored.
* [.guihint]#Disabled# : You have basically chosen not to monitor the service.
* [.guihint]#Vanished# : The service was being monitored, but it now no longer exists.


The page shows all services ordered by these categories into tables. As you have
not yet configured a service, you will only see the [.guihint]#Undecided# table.
To start with, it is easiest to click on [.guihint]#Monitor undecided services#.
That will transfer all services directly into the monitoring, and all [.guihint]#Undecided#
services will become [.guihint]#Monitored# services.

You can always visit this page later to adjust the configuration of the services.
Sometimes new services are created by changes to a host, e.g. when you include a
Logical Unit Number (LUN) as a file system or configure a new Oracle database instance.
These services then reappear as [.guihint]#Undecided#, at which point you can include them
in the monitoring individually or all at once.

Conversely, services can also disappear, for example because a file system has
been removed. These services then appear in the monitoring as {UNKNOWN} and on
this page as [.guihint]#Vanished# and can be removed from the monitoring with [.guihint]#Remove vanished services#.

The button [.guihint]#Fix all# does everything at once -- adding missing
services and removing vanished ones.


[#activate_changes]
== Activating changes

{CMK} initially saves all changes you make only in a temporary 'configuration
environment' that does not yet influence the currently-operating monitoring.
Only by 'activating the accumulated changes' will they be transferred to the monitoring.
You can read more about the background to this in the article on xref:wato[configuring {CMK}].

As we mentioned above, on the top right of each page you will find information on
how many changes have so far accumulated that have not yet been activated.
Click on the link with the number of changes. This will take you to the
[.guihint]#Activate pending changes# page, which lists, among other things, the changes
that have not yet been activated at [.guihint]#Pending changes#:

image::activate_changes.png[alt="List of accumulated changes for activation."]

Now click on the [.guihint]#Activate on affected sites# button to apply the changes.

Shortly after, you will be able to see the result in the sidebar in [.guihint]#Overview#,
which now shows the number of hosts (1) and the number of services you previously
selected. Also in the standard dashboard, which you can reach by clicking on the
{CMK} logo in the top left of the navigation bar, you will now be able to see
that the system has become filled with life.

You have now successfully transferred the first host and its services into the monitoring -- Congratulations!


[#windows]
== Monitoring Windows

Just as for Linux, {CMK} also has its own agent for Windows. This is packaged as
an MSI package. You will find it in the same place as the xref:intro_setup_monitor#download_agent[Linux agent]
(in the {CRE} just next to it under [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows#).
Once you have downloaded the MSI package and copied it to your Windows computer,
you can install it by double-clicking, as is usual with Windows.

*Note:* You may need to configure the xref:agent_windows#firewall[Firewall settings in Windows]
to allow {CMK} access over the network.

Once the agent has been installed, you can add the host to the monitoring.
Follow the same procedure as described above for the Linux host, but create the
host in the designated [.guihint]#Windows# folder. Since Windows is structured differently
from Linux, the agent will naturally find other services.
For a detailed introduction to this subject, see the xref:agent_windows[article on monitoring Windows].


[#snmp]
== Monitoring with SNMP

Professional quality switches, routers, printers and many other devices and appliances
already have a built-in interface for monitoring from the manufacturer -- the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Such devices can be monitored very
easily with {CMK} -- and you don't even need to install an agent.

The basic procedure is always the same:

. In the device's management interface, enable SNMP for *read* access from the IP address of the {CMK} server.

. Assign a *Community* when doing so. This is nothing more than a password for access. Since this is usually transmitted in plain text in the network, it only makes limited sense to choose a very complicated password. Most users simply use the same community for all devices within a company. This also greatly simplifies the configuration in {CMK}.

. In {CMK}, create the host for the SNMP device as xref:intro_setup_monitor#create_host[described above], this time in the designated [.guihint]#Network# folder.

. In the host properties, in the [.guihint]#Monitoring agents# box, check [.guihint]#{CMK} agent / API integrations# and select [.guihint]#No API integration, no {CMK} agent#.

. In the same [.guihint]#Monitoring agents# box, check [.guihint]#SNMP# and select [.guihint]#SNMP v2 or v3#.

. If the Community is not `public`, under [.guihint]#Monitoring agents# again activate the [.guihint]#SNMP credentials# entry, select [.guihint]#SNMP community (SNMP Versions 1 and 2c)# and enter the Community in the input field below.

For the above last three points (4, 5, 6), the result should look like in the following screenshot:

image::host_snmp_configuration.png[alt="Dialogue with properties when creating a host via SNMP: the 'Monitoring agents'."]

*Tip:* If you have created all SNMP devices in a separate folder, simply carry
out the configuration of the [.guihint]#Data sources# for the folder.
This will automatically apply these settings to all of the hosts in this folder.

The rest runs as usual. If you want, you can take a look at the [.guihint]#Test connection to host#
page with the [.guihint]#Save & go to connection tests# button. There you can immediately
see whether access via SNMP works, here for a Cisco Catalyst 4500 switch, for example:

image::snmp_diagnostics.png[alt="Result of the connection test to the host via SNMP."]

On the [.guihint]#Properties of host# page, click on [.guihint]#Save & go to service configuration#
to display the list of all services. This naturally looks completely different
from Linux or Windows. On all devices, by default {CMK} monitors all ports that
are currently in use. You can customise this later as you wish.
In addition, one service that is always {OK} shows you the general information
about the device, and another service shows you the uptime.

A detailed description can be found in the xref:snmp[article on monitoring via SNMP].


[#cloud]
== Clouds, containers and virtual machines

You can also monitor cloud services, containers and virtual machines (VM) with
{CMK}, even if you do not have access to the actual servers. {CMK} uses the
application programming interfaces (API) provided by the manufacturers for this
purpose. These interfaces always use HTTP or HTTPS for access.

The basic principle is always the following:

. Set up an account for {CMK} in the manufacturer's management interface.
. Create a host in {CMK} to access the API.
. Set up a configuration for this host to access the API.
. For the monitored objects such as VMs, EC2 instances, containers, etc., create additional hosts in {CMK} or automate their creation.

You can find step-by-step instructions for setting up monitoring of
xref:monitoring_aws[Amazon Web Services (AWS)], xref:monitoring_azure[Microsoft Azure],
xref:monitoring_docker[Docker], xref:monitoring_kubernetes[Kubernetes]
and xref:monitoring_vmware[VMWare ESXi] in the User guide.
