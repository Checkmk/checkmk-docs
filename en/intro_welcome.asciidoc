*Dear readers,*

we are pleased that you have found your way to {CMK} -- and have visited the
{CMK} User guide while doing so.

The problem-free operation of IT systems has always been a challenge.
Both the complexity of hardware and software stacks and the demands of users
continue to increase -- whether they are working with real hardware or with
cloud solutions. This is why detailed and comprehensive IT monitoring plays
such a central role nowadays.

The requirements that users place on their monitoring are of course as complex
as the IT world itself. {CMK} was developed from the outset for large and
heterogeneous IT landscapes, which is why it offers such a wealth of functions and
options to meet all of the problems that result from this in practice.
For this reason, the comprehensiveness of {CMK} can be overwhelming for a beginner at first.

To make sure you can nevertheless start your first {CMK} monitoring quickly and
more easily, we have divided the {CMK} User guide into two parts for you:

. A Beginner's guide, the introduction to which you are reading now, and which will guide you in the following chapters as you get to know {CMK};
. A comprehensive reference section for experts, which comprises the rest of the User guide.

The Beginner's guide gives you a compact step-by-step introduction to {CMK} and
it is structured in such a way that you can read it quickly from beginning to end
and participate right away. Therefore it is short and concise and does not dwell
on unnecessary details. By the end of the Beginner's guide you will have a functional {CMK}
system. In the xref:intro_bestpractise#[last chapter] we will show you some very
useful tips and tricks from our experienced consultants, which have proven
themselves in various {CMK} installations.

Of course, the Beginner's guide still leaves many questions unanswered.
These are answered in the User guide's reference section. There you will find all of
the background information and details on topics that we can only touch on in
the Beginner's guide, so that you can delve deeper -- on your way from beginner to {CMK} expert.
