== Function

In the business variant, you can create channels for your teams and receive notifications from {CMK} in these.
The connection to Teams is made via a webhook.


== Configuring Teams

In Teams you only need to create a webhook:

. Enter the desired channel.
. Open the three-dot menu in the upper right corner and select [.guihint]#Connectors#.
. Add an [.guihint]#Incoming Webhook#.
. Open the menu again and click [.guihint]#Configure# for [.guihint]#Incoming Webhook#.
. Copy the generated URL.


== Configuration in {CMK}

You have already learned how to set up {CMK} notifications in general in the article on xref:notifications#[notifications].

As a reminder:
