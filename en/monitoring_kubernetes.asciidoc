== Introduction

image::kubernetes_logo.jpg[float=left, width=140]

The great success of link:monitoring_docker.html[Docker] has led to
people using Docker on an ever-larger scale. In contrast to
virtual machines such as link:monitoring_vmware.html[VMWare], its very low overhead
makes the container ‘cheap’, and thus almost a mass-product.
It goes without saying that a good tool for orchestrating the containers is
essential. For the majority, the open source tool
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes[Kubernetes]
will be the tool of choice.

*Important*: The latest Kubernetes Version 1.18 is currently not supported. In the meantime, try out our new Prometheus integration for monitoring Kubernetes.

{CMK} supports monitoring of Kubernetes from Version VERSION[ 1.5.0p12].
The focus is currently on states and metrics that are especially interesting
for the administrator.
The following Check plug-ins are available:

* link:check_k8s_component_statuses.html[Kubernetes component status]
* link:check_k8s_conditions.html[Kubernetes conditions]
* link:check_k8s_namespaces.html[Kubernetes namespaces]
* link:check_k8s_nodes.html[Kubernetes nodes]
* link:check_k8s_persistent_volume_claims.html[Kubernetes persistent volume claims]
* link:check_k8s_persistent_volumes.html[Kubernetes persistent volumes]
* link:check_k8s_pods_cpu.html[Kubernetes pods CPU resources]
* link:check_k8s_pods_fs.html[Kubernetes pods Filesystem resources]
* link:check_k8s_pods_memory.html[Kubernetes pods memory resources]
* link:check_k8s_resources.cpu.html[Kubernetes CPU resources]

* link:check_k8s_resources.pods.html[Kubernetes pod resources]
* link:check_k8s_roles.html[Kubernetes roles]
* link:check_k8s_storage_classes.html[Kubernetes storage classes]

Some new plug-ins have been created since Version VERSION[1.6.0]:

* link:check_k8s_daemon_pods.html[Kubernetes daemon pods]
* link:check_k8s_pod_container.html[Kubernetes pod container statistics]
* link:check_k8s_replicas.html[Kubernetes replicas]

* link:check_k8s_stats.network.html[Kubernetes node and cluster level network usage]

== Setting up the monitoring

=== Service-Account

To set up a Kubernetes cluster in {CMK} you first need to have
a service account and a related Cluster Role in Kubernetes, so that
{CMK} can access the API.
We have created the file `check_mk_rbac.yaml` for you as a ready template
which you will find in the ‘Treasures’, in the
`share/doc/check_mk/treasures/kubernetes` directory,
or online
link:https://github.com/tribe29/checkmk/blob/master/doc/treasures/kubernetes/check_mk_rbac.yaml[here].
The *first part* of this file looks something like this:

.share/doc/check_mk/treasures/kubernetes/check_mk_rbac.yaml
....
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: check-mk
---
kind: ServiceAccount
[...approx 80 further lines...]
....

We use `check-mk` here as the Name and Namespace respectively.

Load this file onto your Kubernetes cluster with the `kubectl` command:

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl apply -f check_mk_rbac.yaml
namespace/check-mk created
serviceaccount/check-mk created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/check-mk created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/check-mk created
{c-end}

If you use the Google Kubernetes engine, it may be that you receive an
`"Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating
get check_mk_rbac.yaml":` response. In this case you must first
extend your user’s permissions. This is done with the following command
(replacing `MYNAME` with your Google login name):

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl create clusterrolebinding MYNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=MYNAME@example.org
{c-end}

// // Hier fehlt:
// // - Der korrekte Prompt. Ist das root? oder wie heißt der User normalerweise?
// // - Die Ausgabe des Befehls

If all has gone well, you can query the new service account with
`kubectl get serviceaccounts`:

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl get serviceaccounts check-mk -n check-mk -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"ServiceAccount","metadata":{"annotations":{},
"name":"check-mk","namespace":"check-mk"}}
  creationTimestamp: "2019-01-23T08:16:05Z"
  name: check-mk
  namespace: check-mk
  resourceVersion: "4004661"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/check-mk/serviceaccounts/check-mk
  uid: 218179a3-1ee7-11e9-bf43-080027a5f141
secrets:
- name: <b class=hilite>check-mk-token-z9hbp*
{c-end}

// // HIER fehlt:
// // - Die Ausgabe des Befehls

There you will also find the name of the associated Secrets. This
has the form ‘`check-mk-token-`_ID _’ (here in the example
<Tt>check-mk-token-z9hbp`).
The ID for the Secret is generated automatically by Kubernetes.
You can then use the contents of the Secrets with
the `get secrets` query:

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl get secrets check-mk-token-z9hbp -n check-mk -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
*  ca.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUM1ekNDQWMrZ0F3SUJBZ0lCQVRBTkJna3Foa2lHO...*
  namespace: Y2hlY2stbWs=
*  token: ZXlKaGJHY2lPaUpTVXpJMU5pSXNJbXRwWkNJNklpSjkuZXlKcGMzTWlPaUpyZFdKbGNtNWxkR1Z6TDNObG...*
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: check-mk
    kubernetes.io/service-account.uid: 218179a3-1ee7-11e9-bf43-080027a5f141
  creationTimestamp: "2019-01-23T08:16:06Z"
  name: check-mk-token-z9hbp
  namespace: check-mk
  resourceVersion: "4004660"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/check-mk/secrets/check-mk-token-z9hbp
  uid: 2183cee6-1ee7-11e9-bf43-080027a5f141
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
{c-end}

The output will include the base64 encoded CA certificate (`ca.crt`),
and the base64 encoded tokens (`token`) for the account.
You can choose the certificate from the output of `get secret` -- e.g.
with the following command cut it out, and immediately convert it to the form
you need to import into {CMK}:


{c-start}
{UP}kubectl get secrets check-mk-token-z9hbp -n check-mk -o yaml | grep "ca.crt" | cut -f4 -d' ' | base64 --decode

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
{c-end}


[#certimport]
=== Importing a certificate into {CMK}

For {CMK} to accept the Kubernetes CA certificate, you must add it to WATO at
[.guihint]#Global Settings|Site Management|Trusted certificate authorities for SSL#.

image::kubernetes_ca.jpg[]

Without the correct import of the CA, the {CMK} service of the Kubernetes
cluster will fail with
<bad handshake>` and `certificate verify failed`:

image::kubernetes_ssl_error.png[]


[#token]
=== Entering a password (Token) in {CMK}

The best way to save the service account token is to use WATO’s password storage.
This is the safest option, since the deposit and the use of the passwords is
organisationally separate. Alternatively, enter the password directly in plain
text when creating the rule (see below).

The following command line truncates the password directly from the output of
`get secrets`:

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl get secrets check-mk-token-z9hbp -n check-mk -o yaml | grep "token:" | cut -f4 -d' ' | base64 --decode
TR:eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJrdWJlcm5ldGVzL3NlcnZpY2VhY2NvdW50Iiwia3ViZXJuZXRlcy5pby9zZXJ2aWNlYWNjb3VudC9uYW1lc3BhY2UiOiJjaGVjay1tayIsI

{c-end}

If you are working directly under Linux, you can also
enter `| xsel--clipboard`.
Then the password is not output, but copied directly to the clipboard
(as if you had copied with the mouse):

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl get secrets check-mk-token-z9hbp -n check-mk -o yaml | grep "token:" | cut -f4 -d' ' | base64 --decode | xsel --clipboard
{c-end}

Tip: If you have the command line tool `jq` installed, the whole process
is a bit easier. `jq` is e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu in the package of the
same name. This is a tool that can access JSON data in a structured way.

This is the command line:
{c-start}
{UP}kubectl get secrets check-mk-token-z9hbp -n check-mk -o yaml | jq -r .secrets[0].name
{c-end}

The ‘password’ really is that long. Add it, for example, under the ID
`kubernetes` in the password storage:

image::kubernetes_password.png[]

=== Adding a Kubernetes-Cluster to the Monitoring

The monitoring under {CMK} functions in two levels. The Kubernetes Cluster
itself is monitored as a host. For the individual Kubernetes nodes
we use the link:piggyback.html[piggyback principle]. That means each node is monitored
as a separate host in {CMK}. The monitoring data from
these hosts are not retrieved separately from Kubernetes, but instead
derived from the data from the Kubernetes cluster.

Because Kubernetes cannot be queried over the normal {CMK} agent --
you need the link:datasource_programs.html#specialagents[Kubernetes Special Agent] --
which is also known as the link:datasource_programs.html[Datasource Program].
In this case {CMK} does not contact the destination host as usual over
TCP port 6556, instead it invokes a utility program that interfaces with the
target system via a Kubernetes application-specific API.

The procedure is as follows:

. Create a host in {CMK} for the Kubernetes master (Kubernetes Control Plane).
. Create a rule that assigns the special agent for Kubernetes to this Kubernetes host.

This rule can be found in WATO at [.guihint]#Host & Service Parameters|Datasource Programs|Kubernetes#.
In the properties of the rule you either enter the
password in plain text, or select it via the password storage if you filed
it there earlier.

image::kubernetes_wato_2.png[]

You do not normally need any further information. The functions of the other
options are best found in the Online Help icon:icon_help[].

If you now call the service configuration at the Kubernets-host
(Discovery) in the WATO, you should already find some of the services:

image::kubernetes_cluster_services.png[]


[#rule]
=== New in Version 1.6.0

Version VERSION[1.6.0] also supports the monitoring of Pods,
Services and Deployments in {CMK}. These are each represented as hosts.
We recommend that you create this host automatically with the
new link:dcd.html[dynamic configuration].

The configuration will now look like this:

image::kubernetes_konfig_v160.png[]

The [.guihint]#Custom URL prefix# has, for example, the format
`https://mykuber01.comp.lan`. If you do not specify this, {CMK} will use
HTTPS as the protocol and use the IP address of the Kubernetes host instead of
a host name in {CMK}. As an alternative, this new configuration allows
HTTP (unsafe), and working with a name instead of an IP address

The [.guihint]#Custom path prefix# is a path which is appended to the URL.
A path prefix is important for Rancher, for example, because there are several
Kubernetes clusters that can be included. An individual’s API clusters can then
be reached -- e.g., at `/k8s/cluster/mycluster`.


=== Monitoring the nodes

So that the nodes are also monitored, you must also create them as hosts in WATO
You can do this (from {CMK} Version VERSION[1.6.0])
with the new link:dcd.html[Dynamic Configuration Daemon (DCD)]. Or you
simply create these as hosts by hand.

It is important that the hostnames in {CMK} exactly match the names of the
Kubernetes nodes.
You can easily get these names from the Kubernetes host’s _Nodes_ service.

image::kubernetes_node_services.png[]

By the way -- with the
[.guihint]#Access to agents|General settings|Hostname translation for piggybacked hosts#
ruleset you can define rules very flexibly, creating them based on the host
names contained in piggy data. This means that you can use host names in {CMK}
that do not match the names of the nodes.

Unless you have a {CMK} agent installed on the nodes themselves (which
would generally be rather unusual), you will need to set the [.guihint]#Check_MK Agent#
to [.guihint]#No agent#.


=== Labels in Kubernetes

In the future -- from Version VERSION[1.6.0+] -- {CMK} for Kubernetes will
automatically discover labels for nodes, pods, services etc.
The labels are defined in the same way as in Docker and have the form
`cmk/kubernetes_object:OBJECT`.

In order to use the advantages of labels for Kubernetes monitoring in
Version VERSION[1.6.0], you can use the
[.guihint]#Monitoring Configuration|Host Checks|Host labels# rule set to change
the behavior of Version VERSION[1.6.0+] manually.
To do this you must create a new label in _one rule_ for
each `OBJECT` and assign it to the corresponding Kubernetes host.
Overall you need the following labels:

* `cmk/kubernetes_object:node`
* `cmk/kubernetes_object:service`
* `cmk/kubernetes_object:deployment`
* `cmk/kubernetes_object:pod`
* `cmk/kubernetes_object:daemon_set`
* `cmk/kubernetes_object:stateful_set`

With the labels for nodes it is recommended to select the folder in which the
Kubernetes nodes are located, or to specify all nodes directly in
‘Explicit hosts’. For the remaining objects you can simply use a regular
expression for the prefix of the Piggyback Hosts in ‘Explicit hosts’
(e.g. `~pod_` for pods). After updating to Version VERSION[1.6.0+] you
can remove the rules you have created.

A final note: the prefix `cmk/` is usually the internal namespace of
{CMK}, to which you should not add any labels.
So that you can use the same rules before and after the update to Version
VERSION[1.6.0+], it is advisable to make a small exception at this point.

== Hardware/software inventory

The Kubernetes integration in {CMK} also supports the
link:Inventory.html[hardware/software inventory]. In Version VERSION[1.5.0p12]
this is limited to the Kubernetes roles. More plug-ins are planned.

image::kubernetes_hw_sw_inventory.png[]


== Removing {CMK}

If you want to remove {CMK}’s service account and cluster role from Kubernetes,
this can be performed with the following commands:

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl delete -f check_mk_rbac.yaml
namespace "check-mk" deleted
serviceaccount "check-mk" deleted
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "check-mk" deleted
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "check-mk" deleted
{c-end}


== Kubernetes in OpenShift installations


=== Creating a project

image::logo_openshift.png[float=left, width=120]

OpenShift is a product line of container application platforms for cloud
computing developed by Red Hat, which is based,
among other things, on Kubernetes.

From Version VERSION[1.5.0p13] {CMK} can also monitor an OpenShift-based
Kubernetes.
The procedure is very similar to that described above, but differs in some
details when setting up the cluster for monitoring. You can create your own
project for monitoring in OpenShift.
This can be performed from the command line with:

{c-start}
{RP}oc new-project check-mk
Now using project "check-mk" on server "https://192.168.42.62:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command.
For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-25-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
{c-end}


=== Creating a service account

The next step is to create a service account. This is done with:

{c-start}
{RP}oc create serviceaccount check-mk
serviceaccount/check-mk created
{c-end}


=== Assigning cluster roles

Openshift already has the `cluster-reader` ClusterRole, with read rights
which you can use for the service account -- it is thus not necessary to set up
a new ClusterRole. You can assign the `cluster-reader` ClusterRole to the
service account with the following command:

{c-start}
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader -z check-mk
cluster role ‘cluster-reader’ added: ‘check-mk’
{c-end}


=== Next steps

The remaining steps for the inclusion of the cluster in the monitoring are as
described at the beginning of this article.
However, you always use the Openshift tool as a command -- `oc` -- in the
command line instead of the `kubectl` described in the article
(e.g. when querying the service account and the token).
You can output the IP address and the cluster’s port with `oc status`.


== Kubernetes in Rancher installations

=== Create a Service-Account

With Rancher, setting up of the monitoring in {CMK} is basically
identical to the setting up directly via Kubernetes variant described above.
Here as well you need the service account so that {CMK} can access the cluster.
You create this directly in the Rancher web interface,
where subsequently you will also find its token and certificate.
These you can then link:monitoring_kubernetes.html#token[import] as described into {CMK}.

In Rancher, first navigate to [.guihint]#Global|Security|Roles|Cluster#
to create a new role, `checkmk`.

[.border]
image::rancher_roles.png[]

For convenience, clone the [.guihint]#Cluster Owner# role.

[.border]
image::rancher_roles_clone.png[]

Under [.guihint]#Grant Resources# revoke the [.guihint]#Create#, [.guihint]#Delete#, [.guihint]#Patch# and
[.guihint]#Update# rights from the cloned role.

[.border]
image::rancher_roles_clone_rights.png[]

Now create a new `checkmk` Rancher user under [.guihint]#Global|Users|Add User#.
In [.guihint]#Global Permissions# select the [.guihint]#User-Base# option to grant the user only
the most necessary reading rights.

[.border]
image::rancher_adduser.png[]

=== Assign cluster roles

Next, switch to your cluster and click on [.guihint]#Edit# in the cluster menu at the
top right. Here you can use [.guihint]#Add Member# to add the newly-created user
[.guihint]#checkmk# with the corresponding role [.guihint]#checkmk# to the cluster.

[.border]
image::rancher_addmember.png[]

=== Next steps

Then log in to Rancher with the new user, go to the cluster and click on
[.guihint]#Kubeconfig File#.
Here are three details you need for monitoring in {CMK}:

* link:.guihint].html#clusters|cluster[server#: URL/path information for the link:monitoring_kubernetes.html#rule[{CMK} rule.]
* [.guihint]#clusters|cluster|certificate-authority-data#: A Base64-encoded certificate.
* [.guihint]#users|user|token#: The access password in the form of a bearer token.

image::rancher_kubeconfig.png[]

You still have to decode the certificate -- for example, on the command line
with `base64 --decode`, or in one of the many online services.
From here the setup in {CMK} corresponds to the procedure for pure Kubernetes
use found in the chapter
link:monitoring_kubernetes.html#certimport[Importing a certificate into Checkmk].

[#eventconsole]
== Monitoring Kubernetes via the Event Console

=== Adding a Rancher Cluster

If you manage your Kubernetes clusters with Rancher, you can
use the link:ec.html[Event Console] to monitor events in Rancher.
In the Rancher interface you can easily activate the connection for an entire
cluster or for individual projects.

Navigate either to your cluster or to a project under [.guihint]#Project/Namespaces# and
there call [.guihint]#Tools|Logging#. The configuration is identical in both cases,
only the heading of the _Cluster Logging_ or _Project Logging_ page
shows where you are. Select [.guihint]#Syslog# as the destination and first enter the
[.guihint]#Endpoint# in the configuration mask -- here your {CMK} server’s IP address
including port `514` -- for example [.guihint]#192.168.178.100:514#
Leave the protocol as [.guihint]#UDP#.
Under [.guihint]#Program# enter the desired name for the log as it should appear in the
Event Console. Finally, you define the log level under [.guihint]#Log Severity# -- for
testing it is recommended to use [.guihint]#Notice# here in order to also get definite
and immediate entries into the system.

[.border]
image::rancher_syslog.png[]

A corresponding link:ec.html#rules[Event Console rule] must run in {CMK} so that the data
also arrives in the monitoring. For example, you can test the value
[.guihint]#Match syslog application (tag)# in the area [.guihint]#Matching Criteria# to test the
log names just assigned under [.guihint]#Program#.

[#ec_rule]
image::kubernetes_ec_rancher_rule.png[]

[#ec_events]

In the {CMK} interface you can now see the events in your cluster or project in
the Events view, which you can access via the [.guihint]#Views# widgets
and [.guihint]#Tactical Overview#. The log name specified in the Rancher configuration
under [.guihint]#Program# appears in the [.guihint]#Application# column.

[.border]
image::rancher_syslog_events.png[]

=== Include other clusters

If the clusters were not set up with an administration like Rancher,
you can have them report to the link:ec.html[Event Console] using Fluentd.
Fluentd is an open source, universal logging solution that can collect data
for Elasticsearch for example, but also for the syslog format.
You can easily run Fluentd as a container using a Kubernetes daemon set.

First, clone the Fluentd repository:

{c-start}
{UP}git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset
{c-end}

This contains various configuration files in YAML format, and the associated
Docker files. To connect to {CMK}, in the DaemonSet configuration
`fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/fluentd-daemonset-syslog.yaml` you only
have to set the `SYSLOG_HOST` value in line 70.
Enter the host name or IP address of the Syslog Endpoint/{CMK} server here --
`192.168.178.101` for example. Leave the the port at [.guihint]#514#,
and the protocol at [.guihint]#UDP#.

.fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/fluentd-daemonset-syslog.yaml (gekürzt)
....
---
containers:
      - name: fluentd
        image: fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset:v1-debian-syslog
        env:
          - name:  SYSLOG_HOST
            value: "192.168.178.101"
          - name:  SYSLOG_PORT
            value: "514"
          - name:  SYSLOG_PROTOCOL
            value: "udp"
---
....

Then use the DeamonSet with the `kubectl` tool:

{c-start}
{UP}kubectl apply -f fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/fluentd-daemonset-syslog.yaml
{c-end}

Depending on the cluster, it will take a little time until the
Fluentd container is running on each node. You will then need another
link:ec.html#rules[Event console rule] which will bring the data into the monitoring.
For testing purposes, the [.guihint]#fluentd# value offers itself as a filter for
[.guihint]#Match syslog application (tag)# in the [.guihint]#Matching Criteria# area to get all
of the events from the Fluentd instances.
In this case set the application to `fluentd` instead of
link:monitoring_kubernetes.html#ec_rule[`Rancher2`]. You will then find the result
as described in link:monitoring_kubernetes.html#ec_events[above] under
[.guihint]#Views|Even Console|Events# or in the [.guihint]#Tactical Overview# -- this time with
the new application name:
