:title: Analyzing the {CMK} site configuration
:description: Analyze configuration allows you to check the site of the {CMK} server for performance, security, processor utilization and more.

== Introduction

Once your {CMK} server has been set up and configured, sooner or later questions will come up: 
Can the configuration be performed more quickly?
Can it be optimized?
Can the system be made more secure?

One approach to answering these questions is to review and consequently optimize the xref:glossar#site[site] setup on the {CMK} server.
The more performant your system is, the faster and more effectively it works.
So the more reliably you can secure your site, the more confident you can be when working with it.

{CMK} quickly and clearly analyzes the essential parameters associated with the current site as well as any attached sites in the case of a xref:glossar#distributed_monitoring[distributed monitoring].

The hosts and services within your site(s) are not affected by these checks, they are still shown in the xref:views#[views of hosts and services].
The results of the site checks covered here are displayed on the [.guihint]#Setup > Maintenance > Analyze configuration# page.

*Note:* When [.guihint]#Analyze configuration# is called, the current state of all checks is always assessed and displayed.
Therefore, after calling the menu item it may take a little while before the page with the results is displayed:

== Interpreting the analysis

The analyzed site data are divided into different categories as so-called _'checks'_.

Each check has a colored status display.
A check can have the following states in the analysis:

[cols="11,8,~"]
|===
|State |Color |Description 

|{OK} |green |The check is completely fine. All checked values are considered optimal.
|{WARN} |yellow |The check is basically fine, but {CMK} has identified potential for improvement.
|{CRIT} |red |The check has detected critical values. These should be examined and fixed if necessary to ensure a smooth operation of {CMK}.
|===

Let's consider the [.guihint]#Backup configured# check with two sites in a distributed monitoring:

image::analyze_config_backup.png[alt="Section of the 'Backup configured' check."]

This check is in a {WARN} state, so an icon:button_ackn_test[alt="Button to acknowledge the message."] button appears after the {WARN} for acknowledging this.
This button also appears for checks in the {CRIT} state.
Acknowledgement causes the yellow or red color of the state to disappear.
The entry itself remains, but becomes visually more discreet.
If the check is acknowledged, the button changes to the icon:button_unackn_test[alt="Button to cancel the acknowledgement."] representation.
This button can also be used to cancel the acknowledgement.

In general, it makes sense to check the system environment for all parameters.
However, if you do not want to run individual checks (again), you can disable any of the checks by clicking on the associated icon:button_disable_test[alt="Button to disable a test."] button.
For example, turn off the [.guihint]#Backup configured# check if your organization uses a different solution for backup creation.


== The checks in detail

For each check, clicking on the associated icon:button_info[alt="Show more information button."] button will give you more details on the detected values, an assessment of the status, as well as hints for optimization.

Much can be readily understood and acted upon based on this.
