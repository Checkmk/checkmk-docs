[#monitoring]
== Essential monitoring tasks

So you have added hosts and we have looked at some important tools -- and now we
are ready to start with the actual monitoring. After all, the whole point of
{CMK} is not to be permanently occupied with the configuration, but to provide
support for IT operations.

It is true that the views available by default, such as the [.guihint]#Overview# snapin,
already show you very precisely how many and what problems currently exist.
But to model a _workflow_, i.e. 'systematic work procedures' with the
monitoring, we need a bit more information on:

* the acknowledgement of problems
* the sending of notifications in the event of problems
* the setting of planned scheduled downtimes

In this chapter we will only deal with the first and the last of the above points.
The notifications will be covered later in a link:intro_notifications.html[separate chapter],
as there are some special preparations that need to be made for this particular subject.


[#ack]
== Problem acknowledgement

In the link:intro_tools.html#overview[Overview] we have already seen that problems can
be flagged as either _unhandled_ or _handled_. Acknowledging is the very
action that turns an unhandled problem into a handled one. This doesn't necessarily
mean that someone is actually working on the problem. Some problems disappear on
their own. But acknowledging helps to maintain an overview and to establish a workflow.

What exactly happens when a problem is acknowledged?

* In the [.guihint]#Overview# the problem will no longer be counted in the [.guihint]#Unhandled# column at the host or service.
* The dashboards also no longer lists the problem.
* The object (host or service) is marked in views with the icon:icon_ack[Icon for indicating acknowledgement.] symbol.
* An entry is made in the object history so that the action can be later retraced.
* Repeating notifications, if configured, will be stopped.

So how do you acknowledge a problem?

First call up a view that contains the problem. The easiest way is to use
the predefined views in the [.guihint]#Monitor > Problems > Host problems# or
[.guihint]#Service problems# menus. By the way, you can almost get to these more quickly
by clicking on the problem count in the [.guihint]#Overview#.

You can click on the problematic host or service in the list and then, on the
page with its details, perform the acknowledgement only for this individual host
or service. However, we will stay on the list page because you have all the
options here to acknowledge only one problem or several problems at once.

It is not at all uncommon that you would like to acknowledge a number of (related)
problems in a single action. This is easily done by clicking [.guihint]#Show checkboxes#
to display a new first column in the list, which contains a checkbox in front of
each row. The checkboxes are all unchecked as the selection is yours -- select
the checkbox for each host or service you want to act on.

*Important:* If you perform an action on a page with a list without checkboxes,
then this action will be performed for *all* of the listed entries.

Now click on [.guihint]#Acknowledge problems#, which will display the following panel at
the top of the page:

image::command_acknowledge.png[Dialog for acknowledging problems.]

Enter a comment and click [.guihint]#Acknowledge# -- and with the confirmation of the
'Are you sure?' question{nbsp}...

image::really_acknowledge.png[Confirmation of acknowledgement.]

&#8230; all of the selected problems will be flagged as having been acknowledged.

Finally, a couple of tips:

* You can also remove an acknowledgement with the [.guihint]#Remove acknowledgement# button.
* Acknowledgements can run automatically. The [.guihint]#Expire acknowledgement after# option serves this purpose

For more information on all parameters for acknowledgement actions,
see the link:basics_ackn.html[article on acknowledgement].


[#downtimes]
== Setting up scheduled downtimes

Sometimes things don't 'break' by accident, but rather on purpose -- or to put it a
little more carefully, a necessary outage can be tolerated. After all, every piece
of hardware or software needs occasional maintenance, and during such work the
respective host or service in the monitoring is very likely to go into the {DOWN} or {CRIT} state.

For those who are supposed to react to problems in {CMK}, it is of course very important that they know about planned downtimes and do not lose valuable time with "false alarms". To ensure this, Checkmk knows the concept of scheduled downtime (or shorter downtime).

So when an object is due for maintenance, you can set it to the scheduled downtime -- either immediately or for a planned time in the future.

Setting up scheduled downtimes is very similar to the process of acknowledging problems.
You start again with a view containing the desired object (host or service)
for which you want to set up a scheduled downtime. For instance, you can click on
the total of hosts or services in the [.guihint]#Overview# to get a list of all objects.

In the list that is displayed, use [.guihint]#Show checkboxes# to show the checkboxes
and then select all of the appropriate entries.

Now click [.guihint]#Schedule downtimes#. This will display the following panel at the top of the page:

image::command_downtime.png[Faded in area for setting a scheduled downtime.]

There is a whole range of options for the scheduled downtimes. You must enter a
comment in each case. By clicking the buttons, you can select the beginning and
end of the downtime. For example, the [.guihint]#2 hours# button declares the
selected objects as 'in maintenance' for two hours from the current time.
In contrast to the acknowledgements, scheduled downtimes will always have
an end time that is set beforehand.

Here are a couple of more tips:

* When you schedule a host for a downtime, all of its services are automatically scheduled as well, thus saving yourself the work of having to do this twice.
* The *flexible* scheduled downtimes actually only commence when the object changes to a state other than {OK}.
* If you use the {CEE}, you can also define *regular* scheduled downtimes -- for instance, for a mandatory reboot once a week.
* You can get an overview of any currently on-going scheduled downtimes in [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > Scheduled downtimes#.

The effects of a scheduled downtime are as follows:

* In the [.guihint]#Overview# the affected objects (hosts and services) no longer appear as having problems.
* The relevant objects are marked in views with the icon:icon_downtime_20[Icon for displaying the scheduled downtime.] symbol.
* For these objects the notification of problems is switched off during scheduled downtime.
* A special notification is triggered at the beginning and at the end of a downtime period.
* In the link:availability.html[availability analysis] planned scheduled downtimes are accounted for separately.
