[#editions]
== Selecting a {CMK} edition

Before you begin installing {CMK}, you must first decide which of the four available editions you want to use:

The {CRE} (*CRE*) is free, 100%{nbsp}Open Source and incorporates Nagios as its core. 
You can use it to comprehensively monitor complex environments. 
Support is available in our link:https://forum.checkmk.com[Forum^] from the {CMK} community.

The {CFE} (*CFE*) is the right one for you if you want to test the {SE} without obligation or if you want to use {CMK} on a small scale with one xref:glossar#site[site]with up to 25 monitored hosts. 
The {FE} contains all of the features of the {SE}, is free of charge and unlimited for the first 30 days. 
Both the {FE} and the {RE} can be upgraded directly to the {SE} later without any extra complications.

The {CSE} (*CEE*) is primarily aimed at professional users and offers a number of interesting features beyond the scope of the {RE},
such as the xref:cmc#[{CMK} Micro Core (CMC)] with its own very high-performance core which replaces Nagios, 
a flexible distribution of {CMK} xref:glossar#agent[monitoring agents] (which obtain information from the monitored target systems),
a large number of sophisticated dashlets to build into xref:glossar#dashboard[dashboards],
reporting, and much more.
For the {SE} you can optionally receive professional support link:https://checkmk.com/product/pricing#/[from us^] or from one of link:https://checkmk.com/partners/find-partner[our partners^].

The {CME} (*CME*) is a multi-client-capable extension of the {SE} which, via xref:glossar#distributed_monitoring[distributed monitoring], has all of the necessary functions for operating an individual {CMK} site for each one of multiple independent customers.
If you want to provide these services for your customers, this is your edition.
More detailed information on the concept of managed services can be found in the introduction xref:managed#[to this article].

You can find a a breakdown of the differences between the editions on our link:https://checkmk.com/product/editions[homepage^].

{cee-only}
Whenever in this User guide we discuss functions that apply only to one of the {EE} -- i.e. the CFE, CEE or CME -- we indicate this with the symbol as in this paragraph.


[#versions]
== Selecting your version

We are continually developing all editions of {CMK} and therefore there are different versions of each edition. 
To get started, we generally recommend the latest stable version. 
A detailed overview of what other versions are available can be found in xref:cmk_versions#[this article].


[#install]
== The software installation

The {CMK} server fundamentally requires a Linux system on which it can run.
(Of course, you can still monitor Windows and other operating systems).
If you do not want to set up your own Linux server, you can also run {CMK} using Docker or an appliance. 
There are four options in total, which we briefly present below and which are installed in different ways. 
When you have finished installing your variant, continue reading in the xref:create_site[next chapter], which is about creating a site.


[#linux_server]
=== Linux server

The installation of {CMK} on a Linux server -- whether on a 'real' or on a virtual machine -- is the standard scenario. 
If you have basic Linux knowledge, the installation is very simple. 
All the software you need is either included in your Linux distribution or in our {CMK} package.

{CMK} supports the following Linux distributions: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based systems, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Debian and Ubuntu.
For each {CMK} edition, {CMK} version and Linux distribution, there is a separate customised package from us that you can xref:install_packages#[install] with the package manager in your Linux distribution.


[#virtual_appliance]
=== The virtual appliance

With the *{CMK} virt1* virtual appliance you get a ready-to-use virtual machine with an OVA (Open Virtualization Archive) file format that you can use in a hypervisor such as VirtualBox or VMware ESXi.

The appliance contains the Linux operating system Debian and a firmware which, among other things, provides a web GUI for managing the appliance.
The advantage with the appliance, apart from a pre-installed system, is that you can configure the operating system, the appliance and {CMK} completely via the graphical user interface without having to use the Linux command line.
The installation of the {CMK} software and the creation of sites is also carried out via the web GUI of the appliance.

The virtual appliance has its own version management, different from the {CMK} software. 
Therefore, you can update the appliance software by installing a new firmware -- independently of the {CMK} software installed in the appliance.

{cee-only}
The virtual appliance is available for all {EE}, and for the {FE} as a free demo version. 
You can find out how to proceed with the installation in the xref:cma_virt1_quick_start#[Quick start guide].


[#physical_appliance]
=== The physical appliance

You can go one step further with the physical appliance -- also known as the hardware appliance.
Here, the complete software you need for {CMK} comes pre-installed and ready to use on a device, for example, to install directly in your data centre. 
You can connect two physical appliances together to form a high-availability cluster (HA cluster) in just a few steps.

The physical appliance is available for the {SE} and the {ME}. 
You can choose between several link:https://checkmk.com/product/appliances[models^] with differing levels of maintenance. 
The instructions for commissioning the appliance can be found in the xref:cma_rack1_quick_start#[Quick start guide].


[#docker]
=== Docker container

If you would like to provide {CMK} using a Docker container, you also have this option. 
We support both {RE} and {EE} with ready-made container images that can be set up with just a few commands.

You can find the instructions for this in the xref:introduction_docker#[article on installing as a Docker container].


[#create_site]
== Creating a site

{CMK} has a special feature that may seem unimportant at first, but it is one which has proven very useful in practice -- you can run several independent _sites_ of {CMK} in parallel on the same server.
Each site can even run a different version of {CMK}.

Here are two common uses for this well thought-out feature:

* An uncomplicated method for trying out a new {CMK} version.
* The parallel operation of a test site for the monitoring of hosts that are not yet used as production system.

If you have just installed {CMK} on a Linux server, there will be no sites as yet. 
In this chapter we will show you how to create a site following an installation of {CMK} software on a Linux distribution.

*Note:* {CMK} appliances are administered via a web GUI that also covers the creation of sites.
This is explained in the xref:appliance_usage#site_management[article on the appliance].
If you are running {CMK} in a Docker container, a site will be created for you automatically during its installation.

First choose a name for your site. 
This may only consist of letters and numbers.
The convention here is lower case letters. 
In the User guide, we use the name `mysite` in examples. 
Replace this name with your own site name.

The creation itself is very simple.
As `root`, simply enter the command `omd create` followed by the name for the site:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd create mysite
Adding /opt/omd/sites/mysite/tmp to /etc/fstab.
Creating temporary filesystem /omd/sites/mysite/tmp...[green]#OK#
Updating core configuration...
Generating configuration for core (type cmc)...
Starting full compilation for all hosts Creating global helper config...[green]#OK#
 Creating cmc protobuf configuration...[green]#OK#
Executing post-create script "01_create-sample-config.py"...[green]#OK#
Restarting Apache...[green]#OK#
Created new site mysite with version 2.1.0p1.cfe.

  The site can be started with *omd start mysite*.
  The default web UI is available at *http://linux/mysite/*

  The admin user for the web applications is *cmkadmin* with password: *jEpCM9T4*
  For command line administration of the site, log in with *'omd su mysite'*.
  After logging in, you can change the password for cmkadmin with *'htpasswd etc/htpasswd cmkadmin'*.
----

When creating a new site, the following events take place:

* A Linux user (without password) and a Linux group are created with the name of the site.
This user is known as the _site user_.
* A home directory is created for the site in the `/omd/sites` directory, e.g. `/omd/sites/mysite`.
This directory is known as the _site directory_.
* A suitable default configuration is copied into the new directory.
* A user with the name `cmkadmin` and a random password is created for the web interface in {CMK}. Make a note of this password. You can also change the password as described below.

*Note:* If you receive this or a similar error message when trying to create the site:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} omd create mysite
Group 'mysite' already existing.
----

then a Linux user or group already exists with the site name you specified.
In such a case, simply choose a different name.

Once you have created the new site, subsequent administration is no longer carried out as the `root`, but instead as the site user.
The easiest way to become a site user is with the following command:

[{shell}]
----
{c-root} su - mysite
{c-omd} 
----

You can see from the changed prompt that you are now logged into the site, and as the command `pwd` shows, you will then be automatically in the site directory:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} pwd
/omd/sites/mysite
----

As you have seen in the output from `omd create`, an administrative {CMK} user named `cmkadmin` is automatically created when the site is created.
This user is for logging into the web interface in {CMK} and has been given a random password. 
As the site user, you can easily change this password:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} htpasswd etc/htpasswd cmkadmin
New password: pass:[*****]
Re-type new password: pass:[*****]
Updating password for user cmkadmin
----

By the way -- whenever we give file path names in the User guide that *do not* begin with a slash, they refer to the site directory.
If you are in this directory, you can therefore use such paths directly in this way.
This also applies, for example, to the file `etc/htpasswd`, whose absolute path here is `/omd/sites/mysite/etc/htpasswd`. 
This file contains the passwords for the {CMK} users of this site. 
Do not confuse this file with `/etc/htpasswd`.


[#start_site]
== Starting a site

A site can be started or stopped. 
The start type is automatic, which means that a started site is also restarted after a reboot of the computer.
Newly-created sites nevertheless begin their lives in a stopped state.
You can easily check this with the command `omd status`, which shows the status of all of the individual processes that are necessary to operate the site:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd status
agent-receiver: [red]#stopped#
mkeventd:       [red]#stopped#
liveproxyd:     [red]#stopped#
mknotifyd:      [red]#stopped#
rrdcached:      [red]#stopped#
cmc:            [red]#stopped#
apache:         [red]#stopped#
dcd:            [red]#stopped#
redis:          [red]#stopped#
crontab:        [red]#stopped#
-----------------------
Overall state:  [red]#stopped#
----

With a simple `omd start` you can start the site:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd start
Temporary filesystem already mounted
Starting agent-receiver...OK
Starting mkeventd...OK
Starting liveproxyd...OK
Starting mknotifyd...OK
Starting rrdcached...OK
Starting cmc...OK
Starting apache...OK
Starting dcd...OK
Starting redis...OK
Initializing Crontab...OK
----

As expected, afterwards the status shows all services as `running`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd status
agent-receiver: [green]#running#
mkeventd:       [green]#running#
liveproxyd:     [green]#running#
mknotifyd:      [green]#running#
rrdcached:      [green]#running#
cmc:            [green]#running#
apache:         [green]#running#
dcd:            [green]#running#
redis:          [green]#running#
crontab:        [green]#running#
-----------------------
Overall state:  [green]#running#
----

{cre-only}
Since the {RE} does not have all the features of the {EE}, you will see fewer services there. 
In addition, you will find `nagios` as the core instead of `cmc`:

[{shell}]
----
{c-omd} omd status
agent-receiver: [green]#running#
mkeventd:       [green]#running#
rrdcached:      [green]#running#
npcd:           [green]#running#
nagios:         [green]#running#
apache:         [green]#running#
redis:          [green]#running#
crontab:        [green]#running#
-----------------------
Overall state:  [green]#running#
----

The `omd` command provides many more options for controlling and configuring sites, and these are described in the xref:omd_basics#[article on sites].
In addition, you can find out how the directory structure for {CMK} is set up in the xref:cmk_commandline#folder_structure[article on {CMK} in the command line].


[#login]
== Logging in

With the site running, you can now proceed. 
Each site has its own URL that you can open in your browser. 
This URL consists of the name or IP address of the {CMK} server, a slash and the name of the site, e.g. `\http://mycmkserver/mysite`.
You will find this login dialog at this address:

image::login.png[alt="{CMK} login dialog.",width=60%]

Now log in with the user name `cmkadmin` and the password you chose or changed at the beginning. 
This will take you to the start page in {CMK}, which we will look at in more detail in the xref:intro_gui#[next chapter].

If your site has not started, you will see the following error message instead of the login dialog:

[{image-border}]
image::intro_omd_site_not_started.png[alt="Error message in the web browser about a not-started site."]

If there is no site with this name at all -- or you have landed on a server without {CMK} -- it will look more like this:

[{image-border}]
image::intro_omd_site_not_found.png[alt="Error message in the web browser about a non-existent site."]

*Important:* As soon as you are running {CMK} as production system, we recommend that for security reasons you only allow access to the interface in a secured manner. 
You can find out what you need to do for this in the xref:omd_https#[article on securing the web interface with HTTPS].

xref:intro_gui#[Continue with the {CMK} user interface].
