A dashboard presents the most important information on a topic on a single page, such as the answer to the question "What is the status of my {CMK} site?"
Different visualizations of data are used and combined in a dashboard, such as views, history graphs, tables, diagrams and many other elements. 
The aim is to present the information from different perspectives to you in such a way that you can grasp the essentials quickly and are not distracted by unnecessary details.

{CMK} provides several preconfigured dashboards that you can open from the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu:
the [.guihint]#Main# and the [.guihint]#Checkmk# dashboard.

The {EE} have a different [.guihint]#Main# dashboard than the {RE}.
The [.guihint]#Main# dashboard of the {RE} is the [.guihint]#Problem# dashboard of the {EE}.

If one of these dashboards is displayed, you can quickly switch to another: 
in the menu bar to the right of the [.guihint]#Help# menu you will find the icons for the available dashboards. 
You can also promote the currently displayed one to [.guihint]#Main dashboard#: 
in the menu [.guihint]#Dashboard > Set as start URL#.

A special feature of the {CMK} dashboards is that by using an intelligent algorithm they automatically adapt to the available screen dimensions and make optimal use of the screen size.

You can also use the individual elements of a dashboard, the so-called *dashlets*, to adapt existing dashboards and create new ones. 
You can learn all the relevant details for this in the xref:dashboards#[article on the dashboards].
